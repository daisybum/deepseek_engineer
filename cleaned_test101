Meriam. At that time, the books represented a revolutionary transformation in undergraduate mechanics education. They became the deﬁnitive textbooks for the decades that followed as well as models for other engineering mechanics texts that have subsequently appeared. Published under slightly differ- ent titles prior to the 1978 First Editions, this textbook series has always been characterized by logical organization, clear and rigorous presentation of the theory, instructive sample prob- lems, and a rich collection of real-life problems, all with a high standard of illustration. In addi- tion to the U.S. versions, the books have appeared in SI versions and have been translated into many foreign languages. These texts collectively represent an international standard for un- dergraduate texts in mechanics. The innovations and contributions of Dr. Meriam (1917–2000) to the ﬁeld of engineer- ing mechanics cannot be overstated. He was one of the premier engineering educators of the second half of the twentieth century. Dr. Meriam earned his B.E., M. Eng., and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University. He had early industrial experience with Pratt and Whitney Aircraft and the General Electric Company. During the Second World War he served in the U.S. Coast Guard. He was a member of the faculty of the University of California–Berkeley, Dean of Engineering at Duke University, a faculty member at the California Polytechnic State University–San Luis Obispo, and visiting professor at the University of California– Santa Barbara, ﬁnally retiring in 1990. Professor Meriam always placed great emphasis on teaching, and this trait was recognized by his students wherever he taught. At Berkeley in 1963, he was the ﬁrst recipient of the Outstanding Faculty Award of Tau Beta Pi, given pri- marily for excellence in teaching. In 1978, he received the Distinguished Educator Award for Outstanding Service to Engineering Mechanics Education from the American Society for Engineering Education, and in 1992 was the Society’s recipient of the Benjamin Garver Lamme Award, which is ASEE’s highest annual national award. Dr. L. Glenn Kraige, coauthor of the Engineering Mechanics series since the early 1980s, has also made signiﬁcant contributions to mechanics education. Dr. Kraige earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Virginia, principally in aerospace v ffirs.qxd 2/13/12 5:47 PM Page vi vi Foreword engineering, and he currently serves as Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. During the mid 1970s, I had the singular pleasure of chairing Professor Kraige’s graduate committee and take particular pride in the fact that he was the ﬁrst of my forty-ﬁve Ph.D. graduates. Professor Kraige was invited by Professor Meriam to team with him and thereby ensure that the Meriam legacy of textbook authorship excellence was carried forward to future generations. For the past three decades, this highly successful team of authors has made an enormous and global impact on the educa- tion of several generations of engineers. In addition to his widely recognized research and publications in the ﬁeld of spacecraft dynamics, Professor Kraige has devoted his attention to the teaching of mechanics at both introductory and advanced levels. His outstanding teaching has been widely recognized and has earned him teaching awards at the departmental, college, university, state, regional, and national levels. These include the Francis J. Maher Award for excellence in education in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, the Wine Award for excellence in uni- versity teaching, and the Outstanding Educator Award from the State Council of Higher Ed- ucation for the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1996, the Mechanics Division of ASEE bestowed upon him the Archie Higdon Distinguished Educator Award. The Carnegie Foun- dation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education awarded him the distinction of Virginia Professor of the Year for 1997. During 2004–2006, he held the W. S. “Pete” White Chair for Innovation in Engineering Education, and in 2006 he teamed with Professors Scott L. Hendricks and Don H. Morris as recipients of the XCaliber Award for Teaching with Technology. In his teaching, Professor Kraige stresses the development of analytical capabilities along with the strengthening of physical insight and engineering judgment. Since the early 1980s, he has worked on personal-computer software designed to enhance the teaching/learning process in statics, dynamics, strength of materials, and higher-level areas of dynamics and vibrations. The Seventh Edition of Engineering Mechanics continues the same high standards set by previous editions and adds new features of help and interest to students. It contains a vast collection of interesting and instructive problems. The faculty and students privileged to teach or study from Professors Meriam and Kraige’s Engineering Mechanics will beneﬁt from the several decades of investment by two highly accomplished educators. Following the pattern of the previous editions, this textbook stresses the application of theory to ac- tual engineering situations, and at this important task it remains the best. John L. Junkins Distinguished Professor of Aerospace Engineering Holder of the George J. Eppright Chair Professorship in Engineering Texas A&M University College Station, Texas fpref.qxd 2/10/12 4:15 PM Page vii Preface Engineering mechanics is both a foundation and a framework for most of the branches of engineering. Many of the topics in such areas as civil, mechanical, aerospace, and agricul- tural engineering, and of course engineering mechanics itself, are based upon the subjects of statics and dynamics. Even in a discipline such as electrical engineering, practitioners, in the course of considering the electrical components of a robotic device or a manufacturing process, may ﬁnd themselves ﬁrst having to deal with the mechanics involved. Thus, the engineering mechanics sequence is critical to the engineering curriculum. Not only is this sequence needed in itself, but courses in engineering mechanics also serve to solidify the student’s understanding of other important subjects, including applied math- ematics, physics, and graphics. In addition, these courses serve as excellent settings in which to strengthen problem-solving abilities. Philosophy The primary purpose of the study of engineering mechanics is to develop the capacity to predict the effects of force and motion while carrying out the creative design functions of engineering. This capacity requires more than a mere knowledge of the physical and mathematical principles of mechanics; also required is the ability to visualize physical conﬁg- urations in terms of real materials, actual constraints, and the practical limitations which govern the behavior of machines and structures. One of the primary objectives in a mechan- ics course is to help the student develop this ability to visualize, which is so vital to problem formulation. Indeed, the construction of a meaningful mathematical model is often a more important experience than its solution. Maximum progress is made when the principles and their limitations are learned together within the context of engineering application. There is a frequent tendency in the presentation of mechanics to use problems mainly as a vehicle to illustrate theory rather than to develop theory for the purpose of solving prob- lems. When the ﬁrst view is allowed to predominate, problems tend to become overly idealized vii fpref.qxd 2/10/12 4:15 PM Page viii viii Preface and unrelated to engineering with the result that the exercise becomes dull, academic, and uninteresting. This approach deprives the student of valuable experience in formulating problems and thus of discovering the need for and meaning of theory. The second view pro- vides by far the stronger motive for learning theory and leads to a better balance between theory and application. The crucial role played by interest and purpose in providing the strongest possible motive for learning cannot be overemphasized. Furthermore, as mechanics educators, we should stress the understanding that, at best, theory can only approximate the real world of mechanics rather than the view that the real world approximates the theory. This difference in philosophy is indeed basic and distinguishes the engineering of mechanics from the science of mechanics. Over the past several decades, several unfortunate tendencies have occurred in engineer- ing education. First, emphasis on the geometric and physical meanings of prerequisite mathe- matics appears to have diminished. Second, there has been a signiﬁcant reduction and even elimination of instruction in graphics, which in the past enhanced the visualization and repre- sentation of mechanics problems. Third, in advancing the mathematical level of our treat- ment of mechanics, there has been a tendency to allow the notational manipulation of vector operations to mask or replace geometric visualization. Mechanics is inherently a subject which depends on geometric and physical perception, and we should increase our efforts to develop this ability. A special note on the use of computers is in order. The experience of formulating problems, where reason and judgment are developed, is vastly more important for the student than is the manipulative exercise in carrying out the solution. For this reason, computer usage must be carefully controlled. At present, constructing free-body diagrams and formulating governing equations are best done with pencil and paper. On the other hand, there are instances in which the solution to the governing equations can best be carried out and displayed using the com- puter. Computer-oriented problems should be genuine in the sense that there is a condition of design or criticality to be found, rather than “makework” problems in which some parameter is varied for no apparent reason other than to force artiﬁcial use of the computer. These thoughts have been kept in mind during the design of the computer-oriented problems in the Seventh Edition. To conserve adequate time for problem formulation, it is suggested that the student be assigned only a limited number of the computer-oriented problems. As with previous editions, this Seventh Edition of Engineering Mechanics is written with the foregoing philosophy in mind. It is intended primarily for the ﬁrst engineering course in mechanics, generally taught in the second year of study. Engineering Mechanics is written in a style which is both concise and friendly. The major emphasis is on basic principles and methods rather than on a multitude of special cases. Strong effort has been made to show both the cohesiveness of the relatively few fundamental ideas and the great variety of prob- lems which these few ideas will solve. Pedagogical Features The basic structure of this textbook consists of an article which rigorously treats the par- ticular subject matter at hand, followed by one or more Sample Problems, followed by a group of Problems. There is a Chapter Review at the end of each chapter which summarizes the main points in that chapter, followed by a Review Problem set. Problems The 124 sample problems appear on specially colored pages by themselves. The solu- tions to typical dynamics problems are presented in detail. In addition, explanatory and cautionary notes (Helpful Hints) in blue type are number-keyed to the main presentation. fpref.qxd 2/10/12 4:15 PM Page ix Preface ix There are 1541 homework exercises, of which approximately 45 percent are new to the Seventh Edition. The problem sets are divided into Introductory Problems and Representa- tive Problems. The ﬁrst section consists of simple, uncomplicated problems designed to help students gain conﬁdence with the new topic, while most of the problems in the second sec- tion are of average difﬁculty and length. The problems are generally arranged in order of increasing difﬁculty. More difﬁcult exercises appear near the end of the Representative Problems and are marked with the symbol (cid:2). Computer-Oriented Problems, marked with an asterisk, appear in a special section at the conclusion of the Review Problems at the end of each chapter. The answers to all problems have been provided in a special section at the end of the textbook. In recognition of the need for emphasis on SI units, there are approximately two prob- lems in SI units for every one in U.S. customary units. This apportionment between the two sets of units permits anywhere from a 50–50 emphasis to a 100-percent SI treatment. A notable feature of the Seventh Edition, as with all previous editions, is the wealth of interesting and important problems which apply to engineering design. Whether directly identiﬁed as such or not, virtually all of the problems deal with principles and procedures inherent in the design and analysis of engineering structures and mechanical systems. Illustrations In order to bring the greatest possible degree of realism and clarity to the illustrations, this textbook series continues to be produced in full color. It is important to note that color is used consistently for the identiﬁcation of certain quantities: • red for forces and moments • green for velocity and acceleration arrows • orange dashes for selected trajectories of moving points Subdued colors are used for those parts of an illustration which are not central to the problem at hand. Whenever possible, mechanisms or objects which commonly have a cer- tain color will be portrayed in that color. All of the fundamental elements of technical illus- tration which have been an essential part of this Engineering Mechanics series of textbooks have been retained. The author wishes to restate the conviction that a high standard of il- lustration is critical to any written work in the ﬁeld of mechanics. Special Features While retaining the hallmark features of all previous editions, we have incorporated these improvements: • The main emphasis on the work-energy and impulse-momentum equations is now on the time-order form, both for particles in Chapter 3 and rigid bodies in Chapter 6. • New emphasis has been placed on three-part impulse-momentum diagrams, both for particles and rigid bodies. These diagrams are well integrated with the time-order form of the impulse-momentum equations. • Within-the-chapter photographs have been added in order to provide additional connection to actual situations in which dynamics has played a major role. • Approximately 45 percent of the homework problems are new to this Seventh Edition. All new problems have been independently solved in order to ensure a high degree of accuracy. fpref.qxd 2/10/12 4:15 PM Page x x Preface • New Sample Problems have been added, including ones with computer-oriented solutions. • All Sample Problems are printed on specially colored pages for quick identiﬁcation. • All theory portions have been reexamined in order to maximize rigor, clarity, readability, and level of friendliness. • Key Concepts areas within the theory presentation have been specially marked and highlighted. • The Chapter Reviews are highlighted and feature itemized summaries. Organization The logical division between particle dynamics (Part I) and rigid-body dynamics (Part II) has been preserved, with each part treating the kinematics prior to the kinetics. This arrangement promotes thorough and rapid progress in rigid-body dynamics with the prior beneﬁt of a comprehensive introduction to particle dynamics. In Chapter 1, the fundamental concepts necessary for the study of dynamics are established. Chapter 2 treats the kinematics of particle motion in various coordinate systems, as well as the subjects of relative and constrained motion. Chapter 3 on particle kinetics focuses on the three basic methods: force-mass-acceleration (Section A), work-energy (Section B), and impulse-momentum (Section C). The special topics of impact, central-force motion, and relative motion are grouped together in a special applications section (Section D) and serve as optional material to be assigned according to instructor preference and available time. With this arrangement, the attention of the stu- dent is focused more strongly on the three basic approaches to kinetics. Chapter 4 on systems of particles is an extension of the principles of motion for a single particle and develops the general relationships which are so basic to the modern compre- hension of dynamics. This chapter also includes the topics of steady mass ﬂow and variable mass, which may be considered as optional material. In Chapter 5 on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion, where the equations of relative velocity and relative acceleration are encountered, emphasis is placed jointly on solution by vector geometry and solution by vector algebra. This dual approach serves to reinforce the meaning of vector mathematics. In Chapter 6 on the kinetics of rigid bodies, we place great emphasis on the basic equations which govern all categories of plane motion. Special emphasis is also placed on forming the direct equivalence between the actual applied forces and couples and their resultants. In this way the versatility of the moment principle is em- phasized, and the student is encouraged to think directly in terms of resultant dynamics effects. and ma I(cid:2) Chapter 7, which may be treated as optional, provides a basic introduction to three- dimensional dynamics which is sufﬁcient to solve many of the more common space-motion problems. For students who later pursue more advanced work in dynamics, Chapter 7 will provide a solid foundation. Gyroscopic motion with steady precession is treated in two ways. The ﬁrst approach makes use of the analogy between the relation of force and linear- momentum vectors and the relation of moment and angular-momentum vectors. With this treatment, the student can understand the gyroscopic phenomenon of steady precession and can handle most of the engineering problems on gyroscopes without a detailed study of three-dimensional dynamics. The second approach employs the more general momentum equations for three-dimensional rotation where all components of momentum are ac- counted for. fpref.qxd 2/10/12 4:15 PM Page xi Preface xi Chapter 8 is devoted to the topic of vibrations. This full-chapter coverage will be espe- cially useful for engineering students whose only exposure to vibrations is acquired in the basic dynamics course. Moments and products of inertia of mass are presented in Appendix B. Appendix C con- tains a summary review of selected topics of elementary mathematics as well as several nu- merical techniques which the student should be prepared to use in computer-solved problems. Useful tables of physical constants, centroids, and moments of inertia are con- tained in Appendix D.

The study of dynamics in engineer- ing usually follows the study of statics, which deals with the effects of forces on bodies at rest. Dynamics has two distinct parts: kinematics, which is the study of motion without reference to the forces which cause motion, and kinetics, which relates the action of forces on bodies to their resulting motions. A thorough comprehension of dynamics will provide one of the most useful and powerful tools for analysis in engineering. History of Dynamics Dynamics is a relatively recent subject compared with statics. The beginning of a rational understanding of dynamics is credited to Galileo (1564–1642), who made careful observations concerning bodies in free fall, motion on an inclined plane, and motion of the pendulum. He was largely responsible for bringing a scientiﬁc approach to the investigation of physical problems. Galileo was continually under severe criticism for refusing to accept the established beliefs of his day, such as the philoso- phies of Aristotle which held, for example, that heavy bodies fall more rapidly than light bodies. The lack of accurate means for the measure- ment of time was a severe handicap to Galileo, and further signiﬁcant development in dynamics awaited the invention of the pendulum clock by Huygens in 1657. Newton (1642–1727), guided by Galileo’s work, was able to make an accurate formulation of the laws of motion and, thus, to place dynamics 1 k c o t S r e p u S / s e g a m I t r A e n F © i Galileo Galilei Portrait of Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) (oil on canvas), Sustermans, Justus (1597–1681) (school of)/Galleria Palatina, Florence, Italy/Bridgeman Art Library 3 c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 4 4 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics . c n I r , s r e h c a e s e R o t o h P / s e m o H g n K s e m a J - l i Artificial hand on a sound basis. Newton’s famous work was published in the ﬁrst edi- tion of his Principia,* which is generally recognized as one of the great- est of all recorded contributions to knowledge. In addition to stating the laws governing the motion of a particle, Newton was the ﬁrst to cor- rectly formulate the law of universal gravitation. Although his mathe- matical description was accurate, he felt that the concept of remote transmission of gravitational force without a supporting medium was an absurd notion. Following Newton’s time, important contributions to mechanics were made by Euler, D’Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, Poinsot, Coriolis, Einstein, and others. Applications of Dynamics Only since machines and structures have operated with high speeds and appreciable accelerations has it been necessary to make calculations based on the principles of dynamics rather than on the principles of statics. The rapid technological developments of the present day require increasing application of the principles of mechanics, particularly dy- namics. These principles are basic to the analysis and design of moving structures, to ﬁxed structures subject to shock loads, to robotic devices, to automatic control systems, to rockets, missiles, and spacecraft, to ground and air transportation vehicles, to electron ballistics of electrical devices, and to machinery of all types such as turbines, pumps, recipro- cating engines, hoists, machine tools, etc. Students with interests in one or more of these and many other activities will constantly need to apply the fundamental principles of dynamics. 1/2 Basic Concepts The concepts basic to mechanics were set forth in Art. 1/2 of Vol. 1 Statics. They are summarized here along with additional comments of special relevance to the study of dynamics. Space is the geometric region occupied by bodies. Position in space is determined relative to some geometric reference system by means of linear and angular measurements. The basic frame of reference for the laws of Newtonian mechanics is the primary inertial system or astro- nomical frame of reference, which is an imaginary set of rectangular axes assumed to have no translation or rotation in space. Measurements show that the laws of Newtonian mechanics are valid for this reference system as long as any velocities involved are negligible compared with the speed of light, which is 300 000 km/s or 186,000 mi/sec. Measure- ments made with respect to this reference are said to be absolute, and this reference system may be considered “ﬁxed” in space. A reference frame attached to the surface of the earth has a some- what complicated motion in the primary system, and a correction to the basic equations of mechanics must be applied for measurements made *The original formulations of Sir Isaac Newton may be found in the translation of his Principia (1687), revised by F. Cajori, University of California Press, 1934. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 5 Article 1/2 Basic Concepts 5 relative to the reference frame of the earth. In the calculation of rocket and space-ﬂight trajectories, for example, the absolute motion of the earth becomes an important parameter. For most engineering problems involving machines and structures which remain on the surface of the earth, the corrections are extremely small and may be neglected. For these problems the laws of mechanics may be applied directly with mea- surements made relative to the earth, and in a practical sense such mea- surements will be considered absolute. Time is a measure of the succession of events and is considered an absolute quantity in Newtonian mechanics. Mass is the quantitative measure of the inertia or resistance to change in motion of a body. Mass may also be considered as the quantity of matter in a body as well as the property which gives rise to gravita- tional attraction. Force is the vector action of one body on another. The properties of forces have been thoroughly treated in Vol. 1 Statics. A particle is a body of negligible dimensions. When the dimensions of a body are irrelevant to the description of its motion or the action of forces on it, the body may be treated as a particle. An airplane, for ex- ample, may be treated as a particle for the description of its ﬂight path. A rigid body is a body whose changes in shape are negligible com- pared with the overall dimensions of the body or with the changes in po- sition of the body as a whole. As an example of the assumption of rigidity, the small ﬂexural movement of the wing tip of an airplane ﬂy- ing through turbulent air is clearly of no consequence to the description of the motion of the airplane as a whole along its ﬂight path. For this purpose, then, the treatment of the airplane as a rigid body is an accept- able approximation. On the other hand, if we need to examine the inter- nal stresses in the wing structure due to changing dynamic loads, then the deformation characteristics of the structure would have to be exam- ined, and for this purpose the airplane could no longer be considered a rigid body. Vector and scalar quantities have been treated extensively in Vol. 1 Statics, and their distinction should be perfectly clear by now. Scalar quantities are printed in lightface italic type, and vectors are shown in boldface type. Thus, V denotes the scalar magnitude of the vector V. It is important that we use an identifying mark, such as an underline V, for all handwritten vectors to take the place of the boldface designation in print. For two nonparallel vectors recall, for example, that V1 (cid:2) V2 and V1 (cid:2) V2 have two entirely different meanings. We assume that you are familiar with the geometry and algebra of vectors through previous study of statics and mathematics. Students who need to review these topics will ﬁnd a brief summary of them in Ap- pendix C along with other mathematical relations which ﬁnd frequent use in mechanics. Experience has shown that the geometry of mechan- ics is often a source of difﬁculty for students. Mechanics by its very na- ture is geometrical, and students should bear this in mind as they review their mathematics. In addition to vector algebra, dynamics re- quires the use of vector calculus, and the essentials of this topic will be developed in the text as they are needed. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 6 6 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics Dynamics involves the frequent use of time derivatives of both vec- tors and scalars. As a notational shorthand, a dot over a symbol will fre- x˙ quently be used to indicate a derivative with respect to time. Thus, means dx/dt and stands for d2x/dt2. x¨ 1/3 Newton’s Laws Newton’s three laws of motion, stated in Art. 1/4 of Vol. 1 Statics, are restated here because of their special signiﬁcance to dynamics. In modern terminology they are: Law I. A particle remains at rest or continues to move with uniform velocity (in a straight line with a constant speed) if there is no unbal- anced force acting on it. Law II. The acceleration of a particle is proportional to the resul- tant force acting on it and is in the direction of this force.* Law III. The forces of action and reaction between interacting bod- ies are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear. These laws have been veriﬁed by countless physical measurements. The ﬁrst two laws hold for measurements made in an absolute frame of reference, but are subject to some correction when the motion is mea- sured relative to a reference system having acceleration, such as one at- tached to the surface of the earth. Newton’s second law forms the basis for most of the analysis in dy- namics. For a particle of mass m subjected to a resultant force F, the law may be stated as F (cid:2) ma (1/1) where a is the resulting acceleration measured in a nonaccelerating frame of reference. Newton’s ﬁrst law is a consequence of the second law since there is no acceleration when the force is zero, and so the par- ticle is either at rest or is moving with constant velocity. The third law constitutes the principle of action and reaction with which you should be thoroughly familiar from your work in statics. 1/4 Units Both the International System of metric units (SI) and the U.S. cus- tomary system of units are deﬁned and used in Vol. 2 Dynamics, al- though a stronger emphasis is placed on the metric system because it is replacing the U.S. customary system. However, numerical conversion from one system to the other will often be needed in U.S. engineering *To some it is preferable to interpret Newton’s second law as meaning that the resultant force acting on a particle is proportional to the time rate of change of momentum of the particle and that this change is in the direction of the force. Both formulations are equally correct when applied to a particle of constant mass. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 7 Article 1/4 Units 7 practice for some years to come. To become familiar with each system, it is necessary to think directly in that system. Familiarity with the new system cannot be achieved simply by the conversion of numerical re- sults from the old system. Tables deﬁning the SI units and giving numerical conversions be- tween U.S. customary and SI units are included inside the front cover of the book. Charts comparing selected quantities in SI and U.S. custom- ary units are included inside the back cover of the book to facilitate con- version and to help establish a feel for the relative size of units in both systems. The four fundamental quantities of mechanics, and their units and symbols for the two systems, are summarized in the following table: *Also spelled metre. As shown in the table, in SI the units for mass, length, and time are taken as base units, and the units for force are derived from Newton’s second law of motion, Eq. 1/1. In the U.S. customary system the units for force, length, and time are base units and the units for mass are de- rived from the second law. The SI system is termed an absolute system because the standard for the base unit kilogram (a platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the In- ternational Bureau of Standards near Paris, France) is independent of the gravitational attraction of the earth. On the other hand, the U.S. customary system is termed a gravitational system because the stan- dard for the base unit pound (the weight of a standard mass located at sea level and at a latitude of 45(cid:2)) requires the presence of the gravita- tional ﬁeld of the earth. This distinction is a fundamental difference be- tween the two systems of units. In SI units, by deﬁnition, one newton is that force which will give a one-kilogram mass an acceleration of one meter per second squared. In the U.S. customary system a 32.1740-pound mass (1 slug) will have an acceleration of one foot per second squared when acted on by a force of one pound. Thus, for each system we have from Eq. 1/1 SI UNITS U.S. CUSTOMARY UNITS (1 N) (cid:3) (1 kg)(1 m/s2) N (cid:3) kg (cid:3) m/s2 (1 lb) (cid:3) (1 slug)(1 ft/sec2) slug (cid:3) lb (cid:3) sec2/ft The U.S. standard kilogram at the National Bureau of Standards . c n I r , s r e h c a e s e R o t o h P / n o r k m O i c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 8 8 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics In SI units, the kilogram should be used exclusively as a unit of mass and never force. Unfortunately, in the MKS (meter, kilogram, sec- ond) gravitational system, which has been used in some countries for many years, the kilogram has been commonly used both as a unit of force and as a unit of mass. In U.S. customary units, the pound is unfortunately used both as a unit of force (lbf) and as a unit of mass (lbm). The use of the unit lbm is especially prevalent in the speciﬁcation of the thermal properties of liq- uids and gases. The lbm is the amount of mass which weighs 1 lbf under standard conditions (at a latitude of 45(cid:2) and at sea level). In order to avoid the confusion which would be caused by the use of two units for mass (slug and lbm), in this textbook we use almost exclusively the unit slug for mass. This practice makes dynamics much simpler than if the lbm were used. In addition, this approach allows us to use the symbol lb to always mean pound force. Additional quantities used in mechanics and their equivalent base units will be deﬁned as they are introduced in the chapters which follow. However, for convenient reference these quantities are listed in one place in the ﬁrst table inside the front cover of the book. Professional organizations have established detailed guidelines for the consistent use of SI units, and these guidelines have been followed throughout this book. The most essential ones are summarized inside the front cover, and you should observe these rules carefully. 1/5 Gravitation Newton’s law of gravitation, which governs the mutual attraction between bodies, is F (cid:3) G m1m2 r2 (1/2) where F (cid:3) the mutual force of attraction between two particles G (cid:3) a universal constant called the constant of gravitation m1, m2 (cid:3) the masses of the two particles r (cid:3) the distance between the centers of the particles G (cid:3) 6.673(10(cid:4)11) m3/(kg (cid:3) s2) The value of the gravitational constant obtained from experimental data is . Except for some spacecraft applications, the only gravitational force of appreciable magnitude in engineering is the force due to the attraction of the earth. It was shown in Vol. 1 Stat- ics, for example, that each of two iron spheres 100 mm in diameter is at- tracted to the earth with a gravitational force of 37.1 N, which is called its weight, but the force of mutual attraction between them if they are just touching is only 0.000 000 095 1 N. Because the gravitational attraction or weight of a body is a force, it should always be expressed in force units, newtons (N) in SI units and pounds force (lb) in U.S. customary units. To avoid confusion, the word “weight” in this book will be restricted to mean the force of gravita- tional attraction. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 9 Article 1/5 Gravitation 9 Effect of Altitude The force of gravitational attraction of the earth on a body depends on the position of the body relative to the earth. If the earth were a perfect homogeneous sphere, a body with a mass of exactly 1 kg would be attracted to the earth by a force of 9.825 N on the surface of the earth, 9.822 N at an altitude of 1 km, 9.523 N at an altitude of 100 km, 7.340 N at an altitude of 1000 km, and 2.456 N at an altitude equal to the mean radius of the earth, 6371 km. Thus the variation in gravita- tional attraction of high-altitude rockets and spacecraft becomes a major consideration. Every object which falls in a vacuum at a given height near the sur- face of the earth will have the same acceleration g, regardless of its mass. This result can be obtained by combining Eqs. 1/1 and 1/2 and canceling the term representing the mass of the falling object. This com- bination gives g (cid:3) Gme R2 where me is the mass of the earth and R is the radius of the earth.* The mass me and the mean radius R of the earth have been found through experimental measurements to be 5.976(1024) kg and 6.371(106) m, re- spectively. These values, together with the value of G already cited, when substituted into the expression for g, give a mean value of g (cid:3) 9.825 m/s2. The variation of g with altitude is easily determined from the gravi- tational law. If g0 represents the absolute acceleration due to gravity at sea level, the absolute value at an altitude h is g (cid:3) g0 R2 (R (cid:2) h)2 where R is the radius of the earth. Effect of a Rotating Earth The acceleration due to gravity as determined from the gravita- tional law is the acceleration which would be measured from a set of axes whose origin is at the center of the earth but which does not ro- tate with the earth. With respect to these “fixed” axes, then, this value may be termed the absolute value of g. Because the earth rotates, the acceleration of a freely falling body as measured from a position at- tached to the surface of the earth is slightly less than the absolute value. Accurate values of the gravitational acceleration as measured rela- tive to the surface of the earth account for the fact that the earth is a rotating oblate spheroid with flattening at the poles. These values may *It can be proved that the earth, when taken as a sphere with a symmetrical distribution of mass about its center, may be considered a particle with its entire mass concentrated at its center. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 10 10 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics be calculated to a high degree of accuracy from the 1980 International Gravity Formula, which is g (cid:3) 9.780 327(1 (cid:2) 0.005 279 sin2 (cid:2) (cid:2) 0.000 023 sin4 (cid:2) (cid:2) …) where (cid:2) is the latitude and g is expressed in meters per second squared. The formula is based on an ellipsoidal model of the earth and also ac- counts for the effect of the rotation of the earth. The absolute acceleration due to gravity as determined for a nonro- tating earth may be computed from the relative values to a close approxi- mation by adding 3.382(10(cid:4)2) cos2(cid:2) m/s2, which removes the effect of the rotation of the earth. The variation of both the absolute and the relative values of g with latitude is shown in Fig. 1/1 for sea-level conditions.* Figure 1/1 Standard Value of g The standard value which has been adopted internationally for the gravitational acceleration relative to the rotating earth at sea level and at a latitude of 45(cid:2) is 9.806 65 m/s2 or 32.1740 ft/sec2. This value differs very slightly from that obtained by evaluating the International Gravity Formula for (cid:2) (cid:3) 45(cid:2). The reason for the small difference is that the earth is not exactly ellipsoidal, as assumed in the formulation of the In- ternational Gravity Formula. The proximity of large land masses and the variations in the density of the crust of the earth also inﬂuence the local value of g by a small but detectable amount. In almost all engineering applications near the sur- face of the earth, we can neglect the difference between the absolute and relative values of the gravitational acceleration, and the effect of local *You will be able to derive these relations for a spherical earth after studying relative mo- tion in Chapter 3. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 11 Article 1/6 Dimensions 11 variations. The values of 9.81 m/s2 in SI units and 32.2 ft/sec2 in U.S. customary units are used for the sea-level value of g. Apparent Weight The gravitational attraction of the earth on a body of mass m may be calculated from the results of a simple gravitational experiment. The body is allowed to fall freely in a vacuum, and its absolute acceleration is measured. If the gravitational force of attraction or true weight of the body is W, then, because the body falls with an absolute acceleration g, Eq. 1/1 gives W (cid:3) mg (1/3) The apparent weight of a body as determined by a spring balance, calibrated to read the correct force and attached to the surface of the earth, will be slightly less than its true weight. The difference is due to the rotation of the earth. The ratio of the apparent weight to the appar- ent or relative acceleration due to gravity still gives the correct value of mass. The apparent weight and the relative acceleration due to gravity are, of course, the quantities which are measured in experiments con- ducted on the surface of the earth. 1/6 Dimensions A given dimension such as length can be expressed in a number of different units such as meters, millimeters, or kilometers. Thus, a di- mension is different from a unit. The principle of dimensional homogene- ity states that all physical relations must be dimensionally homogeneous; that is, the dimensions of all terms in an equation must be the same. It is customary to use the symbols L, M, T, and F to stand for length, mass, time, and force, respectively. In SI units force is a derived quantity and from Eq. 1/1 has the dimensions of mass times acceleration or F (cid:3) ML/T 2 One important use of the dimensional homogeneity principle is to check the dimensional correctness of some derived physical relation. We can derive the following expression for the velocity v of a body of mass m which is moved from rest a horizontal distance x by a force F: Fx (cid:3) 1 2 mv2 1 2 where the is a dimensionless coefﬁcient resulting from integration. This equation is dimensionally correct because substitution of L, M, and T gives [MLT(cid:4)2][L] (cid:3) [M][LT(cid:4)1]2 Dimensional homogeneity is a necessary condition for correctness of a physical relation, but it is not sufﬁcient, since it is possible to construct c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 12 12 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics an equation which is dimensionally correct but does not represent a cor- rect relation. You should perform a dimensional check on the answer to every problem whose solution is carried out in symbolic form. 1/7 Solving Problems in Dynamics The study of dynamics concerns the understanding and description of the motions of bodies. This description, which is largely mathematical, en- ables predictions of dynamical behavior to be made. A dual thought process is necessary in formulating this description. It is necessary to think in terms of both the physical situation and the corresponding mathematical description. This repeated transition of thought between the physical and the mathematical is required in the analysis of every problem. One of the greatest difﬁculties encountered by students is the in- ability to make this transition freely. You should recognize that the mathematical formulation of a physical problem represents an ideal and limiting description, or model, which approximates but never quite matches the actual physical situation. In Art. 1/8 of Vol. 1 Statics we extensively discussed the approach to solving problems in statics. We assume therefore, that you are familiar with this approach, which we summarize here as applied to dynamics. Approximation in Mathematical Models Construction of an idealized mathematical model for a given engi- neering problem always requires approximations to be made. Some of these approximations may be mathematical, whereas others will be physical. For instance, it is often necessary to neglect small distances, angles, or forces compared with large distances, angles, or forces. If the change in velocity of a body with time is nearly uniform, then an as- sumption of constant acceleration may be justiﬁed. An interval of mo- tion which cannot be easily described in its entirety is often divided into small increments, each of which can be approximated. As another example, the retarding effect of bearing friction on the motion of a machine may often be neglected if the friction forces are small compared with the other applied forces. However, these same fric- tion forces cannot be neglected if the purpose of the inquiry is to deter- mine the decrease in efﬁciency of the machine due to the friction process. Thus, the type of assumptions you make depends on what infor- mation is desired and on the accuracy required. You should be constantly alert to the various assumptions called for in the formulation of real problems. The ability to understand and make use of the appropriate assumptions when formulating and solving engi- neering problems is certainly one of the most important characteristics of a successful engineer. Along with the development of the principles and analytical tools needed for modern dynamics, one of the major aims of this book is to provide many opportunities to develop the ability to formulate good mathematical models. Strong emphasis is placed on a wide range of practical problems which not only require you to apply theory but also force you to make relevant assumptions. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 13 Article 1/7 Solving Problems in Dynamics 13 KEY CONCEPTS Method of Attack An effective method of attack is essential in the solution of dynam- ics problems, as for all engineering problems. Development of good habits in formulating problems and in representing their solutions will be an invaluable asset. Each solution should proceed with a logical se- quence of steps from hypothesis to conclusion. The following sequence of steps is useful in the construction of problem solutions. 1. Formulate the problem: (a) State the given data. (b) State the desired result. (c) State your assumptions and approximations. 2. Develop the solution: (a) Draw any needed diagrams, and include coordinates which are appropriate for the problem at hand. (b) State the governing principles to be applied to your solution. (c) Make your calculations. (d) Ensure that your calculations are consistent with the accuracy justiﬁed by the data. (e) Be sure that you have used consistent units throughout your calculations. (f ) Ensure that your answers are reasonable in terms of magni- tudes, directions, common sense, etc. (g) Draw conclusions. The arrangement of your work should be neat and orderly. This will help your thought process and enable others to understand your work. The discipline of doing orderly work will help you to develop skill in prob- lem formulation and analysis. Problems which seem complicated at ﬁrst often become clear when you approach them with logic and discipline. Application of Basic Principles The subject of dynamics is based on a surprisingly few fundamental concepts and principles which, however, can be extended and applied over a wide range of conditions. The study of dynamics is valuable partly be- cause it provides experience in reasoning from fundamentals. This experi- ence cannot be obtained merely by memorizing the kinematic and dynamic equations which describe various motions. It must be obtained through ex- posure to a wide variety of problem situations which require the choice, use, and extension of basic principles to meet the given conditions. In describing the relations between forces and the motions they pro- duce, it is essential to deﬁne clearly the system to which a principle is to be applied. At times a single particle or a rigid body is the system to be isolated, whereas at other times two or more bodies taken together con- stitute the system. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 14 14 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics The deﬁnition of the system to be analyzed is made clear by con- structing its free-body diagram. This diagram consists of a closed out- line of the external boundary of the system. All bodies which contact and exert forces on the system but are not a part of it are removed and replaced by vectors representing the forces they exert on the isolated system. In this way, we make a clear distinction between the action and reaction of each force, and all forces on and external to the system are accounted for. We assume that you are familiar with the technique of drawing free-body diagrams from your prior work in statics. Numerical versus Symbolic Solutions In applying the laws of dynamics, we may use numerical values of the involved quantities, or we may use algebraic symbols and leave the answer as a formula. When numerical values are used, the magnitudes of all quantities expressed in their particular units are evident at each stage of the calculation. This approach is useful when we need to know the magnitude of each term. The symbolic solution, however, has several advantages over the numerical solution: 1. The use of symbols helps to focus attention on the connection between the physical situation and its related mathematical description. 2. A symbolic solution enables you to make a dimensional check at every step, whereas dimensional homogeneity cannot be checked when only numerical values are used. 3. We can use a symbolic solution repeatedly for obtaining answers to the same problem with different units or different numerical values. Thus, facility with both forms of solution is essential, and you should practice each in the problem work. In the case of numerical solutions, we repeat from Vol. 1 Statics our convention for the display of results. All given data are taken to be exact, and results are generally displayed to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, unless the leading digit is a one, in which case four signiﬁcant ﬁgures are displayed. Solution Methods Solutions to the various equations of dynamics can be obtained in one of three ways. 1. Obtain a direct mathematical solution by hand calculation, using ei- ther algebraic symbols or numerical values. We can solve the large majority of the problems this way. 2. Obtain graphical solutions for certain problems, such as the deter- mination of velocities and accelerations of rigid bodies in two- dimensional relative motion. 3. Solve the problem by computer. A number of problems in Vol. 2 Dy- namics are designated as Computer-Oriented Problems. They ap- pear at the end of the Review Problem sets and were selected to illustrate the type of problem for which solution by computer offers a distinct advantage. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 15 Article 1/8 Chapter Review 15 The choice of the most expedient method of solution is an important aspect of the experience to be gained from the problem work. We em- phasize, however, that the most important experience in learning me- chanics lies in the formulation of problems, as distinct from their solution per se. 1/8 CHAPTER REVIEW This chapter has introduced the concepts, deﬁnitions, and units used in dynamics, and has given an overview of the approach used to formulate and solve problems in dynamics.

(a) Determine the mass of the module in both slugs and kilograms, and its surface-level weight in newtons. (b) Now suppose the module is taken to an altitude of 200 miles above the surface of the earth and released there with no velocity relative to the center of the earth. Determine its weight under these conditions in both pounds and newtons. (c) Finally, suppose the module is ﬁxed inside the cargo bay of a space shuttle. The shuttle is in a circular orbit at an altitude of 200 miles above the surface of the earth. Determine the weight of the module in both pounds and newtons under these conditions. For the surface-level value of the acceleration of gravity relative to a rotat- ing earth, use g (cid:3) 32.1740 ft/sec2 (9.80665 m/s2). For the absolute value relative to a nonrotating earth, use g (cid:3) 32.234 ft/sec2 (9.825 m/s2). Round off all answers using the rules of this textbook. Solution. (a) From relationship 1/3, we have (cid:2) [W (cid:3) mg] m (cid:3) W g (cid:3) 100 lb 32.1740 ft/sec2 (cid:3) 3.11 slugs Ans. Here we have used the acceleration of gravity relative to the rotating earth, be- cause that is the condition of the module in part (a). Note that we are using more signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the acceleration of gravity than will normally be required in this textbook (32.2 ft/sec2 and 9.81 m/s2 will normally sufﬁce). From the table of conversion factors inside the front cover of the textbook, we see that 1 pound is equal to 4.4482 newtons. Thus, the weight of the module in newtons is (cid:3) W (cid:3) 100 lb (cid:2)4.4482 N (cid:3) (cid:3) 445 N 1 lb Finally, its mass in kilograms is (cid:4) [W (cid:3) mg] m (cid:3) W g (cid:3) 445 N 9.80665 m/s2 (cid:3) 45.4 kg Ans. Ans. As another route to the last result, we may convert from pounds mass to kilograms. Again using the table inside the front cover, we have m (cid:3) 100 lbm (cid:2)0.45359 kg (cid:3) (cid:3) 45.4 kg 1 lbm We recall that 1 lbm is the amount of mass which under standard conditions has a weight of 1 lb of force. We rarely refer to the U.S. mass unit lbm in this text- book series, but rather use the slug for mass. The sole use of slug, rather than the unnecessary use of two units for mass, will prove to be powerful and simple. Helpful Hints (cid:2) Our calculator indicates a result of 3.108099 (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3) slugs. Using the rules of signiﬁcant ﬁgure display used in this textbook, we round the written result to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, or 3.11 slugs. Had the numerical result begun with the digit 1, we would have rounded the displayed answer to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures. (cid:3) A good practice with unit conversion is to multiply by a factor such as (cid:3) (cid:2)4.4482 N 1 lb , which has a value of 1, because the numerator and the de- nominator are equivalent. Be sure that cancellation of the units leaves the units desired—here the units of lb cancel, leaving the desired units of N. (cid:3) (cid:4) Note that we are using a previously calculated result (445 N). We must be sure that when a calculated num- ber is needed in subsequent calcula- tions, it is obtained in the calculator to its full accuracy (444.82 (cid:3) (cid:3)). If necessary, numbers must be stored in a calculator storage register and then brought out of the register when needed. We must not merely punch 445 into our calculator and proceed to divide by 9.80665—this practice will result in loss of numeri- cal accuracy. Some individuals like to place a small indication of the storage register used in the right margin of the work paper, directly beside the number stored. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 17 SAMPLE PROBLEM 1/1 (CONTINUED) (b) We begin by calculating the absolute acceleration of gravity (relative to the nonrotating earth) at an altitude of 200 miles.

We note that the weight of the module when at an altitude of 200 mi is about 90% of its surface-level weight—it is not weightless. We will study the effects of this weight on the motion of the module in Chapter 3. (c) The weight of an object (the force of gravitational attraction) does not depend on the motion of the object.

First, just because a body is raised to a typical shuttle altitude, it does not become weightless. This is true whether the body is released with no velocity relative to the center of the earth, is inside the orbiting shuttle, or is in its own arbitrary trajectory. And second, the acceleration of gravity is not zero at such altitudes. The only way to reduce both the acceleration of gravity and the corresponding weight of a body to zero is to take the body to an inﬁnite distance from the earth. c01.qxd 2/8/12 7:02 PM Page 18 18 Chapter 1 Introduction to Dynamics PROBLEMS (Refer to Table D/2 in Appendix D for relevant solar- system values.) 1/1 Determine your mass in slugs.

Kinematics is often described as the “geometry of motion.” Some engineering applications of kinematics include the design of cams, gears, linkages, and other machine elements to control or produce certain desired motions, and the calculation of ﬂight trajectories for aircraft, rockets, and spacecraft. A thorough work- ing knowledge of kinematics is a prerequisite to kinetics, which is the study of the relationships between motion and the corresponding forces which cause or accompany the motion. Particle Motion We begin our study of kinematics by ﬁrst discussing in this chapter the motions of points or particles. A particle is a body whose physical di- mensions are so small compared with the radius of curvature of its path that we may treat the motion of the particle as that of a point. For ex- ample, the wingspan of a jet transport ﬂying between Los Angeles and New York is of no consequence compared with the radius of curvature of 21 c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:10 PM Page 22 22 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles z y n t BP A R φ θ x r y z Path x Figure 2/1 – s O P P′ + s s s Figure 2/2 its ﬂight path, and thus the treatment of the airplane as a particle or point is an acceptable approximation. We can describe the motion of a particle in a number of ways, and the choice of the most convenient or appropriate way depends a great deal on experience and on how the data are given. Let us obtain an overview of the several methods developed in this chapter by referring to Fig. 2/1, which shows a particle P moving along some general path in space. If the particle is confined to a specified path, as with a bead sliding along a ﬁxed wire, its motion is said to be constrained. If there are no physical guides, the motion is said to be unconstrained. A small rock tied to the end of a string and whirled in a circle undergoes con- strained motion until the string breaks, after which instant its motion is unconstrained. Choice of Coordinates The position of particle P at any time t can be described by specify- ing its rectangular coordinates* x, y, z, its cylindrical coordinates r, (cid:2), z, or its spherical coordinates R, (cid:2), (cid:3). The motion of P can also be de- scribed by measurements along the tangent t and normal n to the curve. The direction of n lies in the local plane of the curve.† These last two measurements are called path variables. The motion of particles (or rigid bodies) can be described by using co- ordinates measured from ﬁxed reference axes (absolute-motion analysis) or by using coordinates measured from moving reference axes (relative- motion analysis). Both descriptions will be developed and applied in the articles which follow. With this conceptual picture of the description of particle motion in mind, we restrict our attention in the ﬁrst part of this chapter to the case of plane motion where all movement occurs in or can be repre- sented as occurring in a single plane. A large proportion of the motions of machines and structures in engineering can be represented as plane motion. Later, in Chapter 7, an introduction to three-dimensional mo- tion is presented. We begin our discussion of plane motion with recti- linear motion, which is motion along a straight line, and follow it with a description of motion along a plane curve. 2/2 Rectilinear Motion Consider a particle P moving along a straight line, Fig. 2/2. The po- sition of P at any instant of time t can be speciﬁed by its distance s mea- sured from some convenient reference point O ﬁxed on the line. At time t (cid:2) (cid:3)t the particle has moved to P(cid:2) and its coordinate becomes s (cid:2) (cid:3)s. The change in the position coordinate during the interval (cid:3)t is called the displacement (cid:3)s of the particle. The displacement would be negative if the particle moved in the negative s-direction. *Often called Cartesian coordinates, named after René Descartes (1596–1650), a French mathematician who was one of the inventors of analytic geometry. †This plane is called the osculating plane, which comes from the Latin word osculari mean- ing “to kiss.” The plane which contains P and the two points A and B, one on either side of P, becomes the osculating plane as the distances between the points approach zero. Δ c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:10 PM Page 23 Article 2/2 Rectilinear Motion 23 Velocity and Acceleration The average velocity of the particle during the interval (cid:3)t is the dis- placement divided by the time interval or vav (cid:4) (cid:3)s/(cid:3)t. As (cid:3)t becomes smaller and approaches zero in the limit, the average velocity approaches the instantaneous velocity of the particle, which is v (cid:4) lim (cid:3)tl0 (cid:3)s (cid:3)t or v (cid:4) ds dt (cid:4) s˙ (2/1) Thus, the velocity is the time rate of change of the position coordinate s. The velocity is positive or negative depending on whether the corre- sponding displacement is positive or negative. The average acceleration of the particle during the interval (cid:3)t is the change in its velocity divided by the time interval or aav (cid:4) (cid:3)v/(cid:3)t. As (cid:3)t becomes smaller and approaches zero in the limit, the average accelera- tion approaches the instantaneous acceleration of the particle, which is a (cid:4) lim (cid:3)tl0 (cid:3)v (cid:3)t or a (cid:4) dv dt (cid:4) v˙ or a (cid:4) d2s dt2 (cid:4) s¨ (2/2) The acceleration is positive or negative depending on whether the ve- locity is increasing or decreasing. Note that the acceleration would be positive if the particle had a negative velocity which was becoming less negative. If the particle is slowing down, the particle is said to be decelerating. Velocity and acceleration are actually vector quantities, as we will see for curvilinear motion beginning with Art. 2/3. For rectilinear mo- tion in the present article, where the direction of the motion is that of the given straight-line path, the sense of the vector along the path is de- scribed by a plus or minus sign. In our treatment of curvilinear motion, we will account for the changes in direction of the velocity and accelera- tion vectors as well as their changes in magnitude. By eliminating the time dt between Eq. 2/1 and the ﬁrst of Eqs. 2/2, we obtain a differential equation relating displacement, velocity, and ac- celeration.* This equation is v dv (cid:4) a ds or s˙ ds˙ (cid:4) s¨ ds (2/3) Equations 2/1, 2/2, and 2/3 are the differential equations for the rec- tilinear motion of a particle. Problems in rectilinear motion involving ﬁ- nite changes in the motion variables are solved by integration of these basic differential relations. The position coordinate s, the velocity v, and the acceleration a are algebraic quantities, so that their signs, positive or negative, must be carefully observed. Note that the positive direc- tions for v and a are the same as the positive direction for s. *Differential quantities can be multiplied and divided in exactly the same way as other algebraic quantities. This sprinter will undergo rectilinear acceleration until he reaches his ter- minal speed. . c n I , a c i r e m A k c o t s o t o F e g A / t f r t a c a a D © c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:10 PM Page 24 24 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles s v a (a) (b) (c) a v (a) (b) ds · — v = = s dt 1 t1 t t2 dv · — a = = v dt t2 1 dt t1 v a t1 dt t2 Figure 2/3 Graphical Interpretations Interpretation of the differential equations governing rectilinear motion is considerably clariﬁed by representing the relationships among s, v, a, and t graphically. Figure 2/3a is a schematic plot of the variation of s with t from time t1 to time t2 for some given rectilinear motion. By constructing the tangent to the curve at any time t, we obtain the slope, which is the velocity v (cid:4) ds/dt. Thus, the velocity can be determined at all points on the curve and plotted against the corresponding time as shown in Fig. 2/3b. Similarly, the slope dv/dt of the v-t curve at any in- stant gives the acceleration at that instant, and the a-t curve can there- fore be plotted as in Fig. 2/3c. We now see from Fig. 2/3b that the area under the v-t curve during time dt is v dt, which from Eq. 2/1 is the displacement ds. Consequently, the net displacement of the particle during the interval from t1 to t2 is the corresponding area under the curve, which is (cid:2) s2 ds (cid:4) (cid:2) t2 s1 t1 v dt or s2 (cid:5) s1 (cid:4) (area under v-t curve) Similarly, from Fig. 2/3c we see that the area under the a-t curve during time dt is a dt, which, from the ﬁrst of Eqs. 2/2, is dv. Thus, the net change in velocity between t1 and t2 is the corresponding area under the curve, which is (cid:2) v2 dv (cid:4) (cid:2) t2 v1 t1 a dt or v2 (cid:5) v1 (cid:4) (area under a-t curve) Note two additional graphical relations. When the acceleration a is plotted as a function of the position coordinate s, Fig. 2/4a, the area under the curve during a displacement ds is a ds, which, from Eq. 2/3, is v dv (cid:4) d(v2/2). Thus, the net area under the curve between position co- ordinates s1 and s2 is t t t (cid:2) v2 v dv (cid:4) (cid:2) s2 v1 s1 a ds or 1 2 (v2 2 (cid:5) v1 2) (cid:4) (area under a-s curve) a A v C s1 s1 s s2 ds 1 dv — ds B s s2 a Figure 2/4 When the velocity v is plotted as a function of the position coordinate s, Fig. 2/4b, the slope of the curve at any point A is dv/ds. By constructing the normal AB to the curve at this point, we see from the similar trian- (cid:4) dv/ds. Thus, from Eq. 2/3, (cid:4) v(dv/ds) (cid:4) a, the accel- gles that eration. It is necessary that the velocity and position coordinate axes have the same numerical scales so that the acceleration read on the po- sition coordinate scale in meters (or feet), say, will represent the actual acceleration in meters (or feet) per second squared. CB/v CB The graphical representations described are useful not only in visu- alizing the relationships among the several motion quantities but also in obtaining approximate results by graphical integration or differentia- tion. The latter case occurs when a lack of knowledge of the mathemati- cal relationship prevents its expression as an explicit mathematical function which can be integrated or differentiated. Experimental data and motions which involve discontinuous relationships between the variables are frequently analyzed graphically. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:10 PM Page 25 Article 2/2 Rectilinear Motion 25 KEY CONCEPTS Analytical Integration If the position coordinate s is known for all values of the time t, then successive mathematical or graphical differentiation with respect to t gives the velocity v and acceleration a. In many problems, however, the functional relationship between position coordinate and time is un- known, and we must determine it by successive integration from the ac- celeration. Acceleration is determined by the forces which act on moving bodies and is computed from the equations of kinetics discussed in subse- quent chapters. Depending on the nature of the forces, the acceleration may be speciﬁed as a function of time, velocity, or position coordinate, or as a combined function of these quantities. The procedure for integrating the differential equation in each case is indicated as follows. (a) Constant Acceleration. When a is constant, the ﬁrst of Eqs. 2/2 and 2/3 can be integrated directly. For simplicity with s (cid:4) s0, v (cid:4) v0, and t (cid:4) 0 designated at the beginning of the interval, then for a time inter- val t the integrated equations become dv (cid:4) a (cid:2) t (cid:2) v v dv (cid:4) a (cid:2) s (cid:2) v v0 0 v0 s0 dt or v (cid:4) v0 (cid:2) at ds or v2 (cid:4) v0 2 (cid:2) 2a(s (cid:5) s0) Substitution of the integrated expression for v into Eq. 2/1 and integra- tion with respect to t give (cid:2) s s0 ds (cid:4) (cid:2) t 0 (v0 (cid:2) at) dt or s (cid:4) s0 (cid:2) v0 t (cid:2) 1 2 at2 These relations are necessarily restricted to the special case where the acceleration is constant. The integration limits depend on the initial and ﬁnal conditions, which for a given problem may be different from those used here. It may be more convenient, for instance, to begin the integra- tion at some speciﬁed time t1 rather than at time t (cid:4) 0. Caution: The foregoing equations have been integrated for constant acceleration only. A common mistake is to use these equations for problems involving variable ac- celeration, where they do not apply. (b) Acceleration Given as a Function of Time, a (cid:4) ƒ(t). Substitu- tion of the function into the ﬁrst of Eqs. 2/2 gives ƒ(t) (cid:4) dv/dt. Multiply- ing by dt separates the variables and permits integration. Thus, (cid:2) v v0 dv (cid:4) (cid:2) t ƒ(t) dt or 0 v (cid:4) v0 (cid:2) (cid:2) t ƒ(t) dt 0 c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:10 PM Page 26 26 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles From this integrated expression for v as a function of t, the position co- ordinate s is obtained by integrating Eq. 2/1, which, in form, would be (cid:2) s s0 ds (cid:4) (cid:2) t v dt 0 or s (cid:4) s0 (cid:2) (cid:2) t v dt 0 If the indeﬁnite integral is employed, the end conditions are used to es- tablish the constants of integration. The results are identical with those obtained by using the deﬁnite integral. If desired, the displacement s can be obtained by a direct solution of the second-order differential equation (cid:4) ƒ(t) obtained by substitution of ƒ(t) into the second of Eqs. 2/2. s¨ (c) Acceleration Given as a Function of Velocity, a (cid:4) ƒ(v). Substi- tution of the function into the ﬁrst of Eqs. 2/2 gives ƒ(v) (cid:4) dv/dt, which permits separating the variables and integrating. Thus, t (cid:4) (cid:2) t dt (cid:4) (cid:2) v 0 v0 dv ƒ(v) This result gives t as a function of v. Then it would be necessary to solve for v as a function of t so that Eq. 2/1 can be integrated to obtain the po- sition coordinate s as a function of t. Another approach is to substitute the function a (cid:4) ƒ(v) into the ﬁrst of Eqs. 2/3, giving v dv (cid:4) ƒ(v) ds. The variables can now be separated and the equation integrated in the form (cid:2) v v0 (cid:4) (cid:2) s s0 v dv ƒ(v) ds or s (cid:4) s0 (cid:2) (cid:2) v v0 v dv ƒ(v) Note that this equation gives s in terms of v without explicit reference to t. (d) Acceleration Given as a Function of Displacement, a (cid:4) ƒ(s). Substituting the function into Eq. 2/3 and integrating give the form (cid:2) v v dv (cid:4) (cid:2) s v0 s0 ƒ(s) ds or v2 (cid:4) v0 2 (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) s s0 ƒ(s) ds Next we solve for v to give v (cid:4) g(s), a function of s. Now we can substi- tute ds/dt for v, separate variables, and integrate in the form (cid:2) s s0 ds g(s) (cid:4) (cid:2) t dt 0 or t (cid:4) (cid:2) s s0 ds g(s) which gives t as a function of s. Finally, we can rearrange to obtain s as a function of t. In each of the foregoing cases when the acceleration varies according to some functional relationship, the possibility of solving the equations by direct mathematical integration will depend on the form of the function. In cases where the integration is excessively awkward or difﬁcult, integra- tion by graphical, numerical, or computer methods can be utilized. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:10 PM Page 27 Article 2/2 Rectilinear Motion 27 SAMPLE PROBLEM 2/1 The position coordinate of a particle which is conﬁned to move along a straight line is given by s (cid:4) 2t3 (cid:5) 24t (cid:2) 6, where s is measured in meters from a convenient origin and t is in seconds.

The two springs together exert a retarding force to the motion of the slider, which gives it an acceleration proportional to the displace- ment but oppositely directed and equal to a (cid:4) (cid:5)k2s, where k is constant. (The constant is arbitrarily squared for later convenience in the form of the expres- sions.) Determine the expressions for the displacement s and velocity v as func- tions of the time t. (cid:3) (cid:4) Solution I. Since the acceleration is speciﬁed in terms of the displacement, the differential relation v dv (cid:4) a ds may be integrated.

This motion is a special case of the more general three- dimensional motion introduced in Art. 2/1 and illustrated in Fig. 2/1. If we let the plane of motion be the x-y plane, for instance, then the coordinates z and (cid:3) of Fig. 2/1 are both zero, and R becomes the same as r. As men- tioned previously, the vast majority of the motions of points or particles encountered in engineering practice can be represented as plane motion. Before pursuing the description of plane curvilinear motion in any speciﬁc set of coordinates, we will ﬁrst use vector analysis to describe the motion, since the results will be independent of any particular coor- dinate system. What follows in this article constitutes one of the most basic concepts in dynamics, namely, the time derivative of a vector. Much analysis in dynamics utilizes the time rates of change of vector quantities. You are therefore well advised to master this topic at the outset because you will have frequent occasion to use it. Consider now the continuous motion of a particle along a plane curve as represented in Fig. 2/5. At time t the particle is at position A, which is located by the position vector r measured from some convenient ﬁxed ori- gin O. If both the magnitude and direction of r are known at time t, then the position of the particle is completely speciﬁed. At time t (cid:2) (cid:3)t, the particle is at A(cid:2), located by the position vector r (cid:2) (cid:3)r. We note, of course, that this combination is vector addition and not scalar addition. The dis- placement of the particle during time (cid:3)t is the vector (cid:3)r which represents the vector change of position and is clearly independent of the choice of origin. If an origin were chosen at some different location, the position vector r would be changed, but (cid:3)r would be unchanged. The distance actually traveled by the particle as it moves along the path from A to A(cid:2) is the scalar length (cid:3)s measured along the path. Thus, we distinguish between the vector displacement (cid:3)r and the scalar distance (cid:3)s. Velocity The average velocity of the particle between A and A(cid:2) is deﬁned as vav (cid:4) (cid:3)r/(cid:3)t, which is a vector whose direction is that of (cid:3)r and whose magnitude is the magnitude of (cid:3)r divided by (cid:3)t. The average speed of Path of particle A′ Δ s Δ r A r + Δ r r O v′ v A′ A Δ v v′ a v A Figure 2/5 c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 41 Article 2/3 Plane Curvilinear Motion 41 the particle between A and A(cid:2) is the scalar quotient (cid:3)s/(cid:3)t. Clearly, the magnitude of the average velocity and the speed approach one another as the interval (cid:3)t decreases and A and A(cid:2) become closer together. The instantaneous velocity v of the particle is deﬁned as the limiting value of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero. Thus, v (cid:4) lim (cid:3)tl0 (cid:3)r (cid:3)t We observe that the direction of (cid:3)r approaches that of the tangent to the path as (cid:3)t approaches zero and, thus, the velocity v is always a vec- tor tangent to the path. We now extend the basic deﬁnition of the derivative of a scalar quantity to include a vector quantity and write v (cid:4) dr dt (cid:4) r˙ (2/4) The derivative of a vector is itself a vector having both a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude of v is called the speed and is the scalar v (cid:4) (cid:6)v (cid:6) (cid:4) ds dt (cid:4) s˙ s˙ At this point we make a careful distinction between the magnitude of the derivative and the derivative of the magnitude. The magnitude of the derivative can be written in any one of the several ways (cid:6)dr/dt(cid:6) (cid:4) (cid:6) r˙(cid:6) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:6)v(cid:6) (cid:4) v and represents the magnitude of the velocity, or the speed, of the particle. On the other hand, the derivative of the magni- tude is written d(cid:6)r(cid:6)/dt (cid:4) dr/dt (cid:4) , and represents the rate at which the length of the position vector r is changing. Thus, these two derivatives have two entirely different meanings, and we must be extremely careful to distinguish between them in our thinking and in our notation. For this and other reasons, you are urged to adopt a consistent notation for handwritten work for all vector quantities to distinguish them from scalar quantities. For simplicity the underline v is recommended. Other handwritten symbols such as , and are sometimes used. r˙ vˆ v~v9 , With the concept of velocity as a vector established, we return to Fig. 2/5 and denote the velocity of the particle at A by the tangent vector v and the velocity at A(cid:2) by the tangent v(cid:2). Clearly, there is a vector change in the velocity during the time (cid:3)t. The velocity v at A plus (vectorially) the change (cid:3)v must equal the velocity at A(cid:2), so we can write v(cid:2) (cid:5) v (cid:4) (cid:3)v. In- spection of the vector diagram shows that (cid:3)v depends both on the change in magnitude (length) of v and on the change in direction of v. These two changes are fundamental characteristics of the derivative of a vector. Acceleration The average acceleration of the particle between A and A(cid:2) is deﬁned as (cid:3)v/(cid:3)t, which is a vector whose direction is that of (cid:3)v. The magnitude of this average acceleration is the magnitude of (cid:3)v divided by (cid:3)t. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 42 42 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles The instantaneous acceleration a of the particle is deﬁned as the limiting value of the average acceleration as the time interval ap- proaches zero. Thus, a (cid:4) lim (cid:3)tl0 (cid:3)v (cid:3)t By deﬁnition of the derivative, then, we write a (cid:4) dv dt (cid:4) v˙ (2/5) As the interval (cid:3)t becomes smaller and approaches zero, the direction of the change (cid:3)v approaches that of the differential change dv and, thus, of a. The acceleration a, then, includes the effects of both the change in magnitude of v and the change of direction of v. It is apparent, in gen- eral, that the direction of the acceleration of a particle in curvilinear motion is neither tangent to the path nor normal to the path. We do ob- serve, however, that the acceleration component which is normal to the path points toward the center of curvature of the path. Visualization of Motion A further approach to the visualization of acceleration is shown in Fig. 2/6, where the position vectors to three arbitrary positions on the path of the particle are shown for illustrative purpose. There is a velocity vector tangent to the path corresponding to each position vector, and the relation is v (cid:4) . If these velocity vectors are now plotted from some ar- bitrary point C, a curve, called the hodograph, is formed. The derivatives of these velocity vectors will be the acceleration vectors a (cid:4) which are tangent to the hodograph. We see that the acceleration has the same re- lation to the velocity as the velocity has to the position vector. r˙ v˙ The geometric portrayal of the derivatives of the position vector r and velocity vector v in Fig. 2/5 can be used to describe the derivative of any vector quantity with respect to t or with respect to any other scalar variable. Now that we have used the deﬁnitions of velocity and accelera- tion to introduce the concept of the derivative of a vector, it is important to establish the rules for differentiating vector quantities. These rules · v3 = r 3 Path · v2 = r 2 r3 O r2 r1 v1 = r· 1 · a3 = v 3 · a2 = v 2 Hodograph v3 a1 = v· 1 v2 v1 C Figure 2/6 c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 43 Article 2/4 Rectangular Coordinates (x-y) 43 are the same as for the differentiation of scalar quantities, except for the case of the cross product where the order of the terms must be pre- served. These rules are covered in Art. C/7 of Appendix C and should be reviewed at this point. Three different coordinate systems are commonly used for describing the vector relationships for curvilinear motion of a particle in a plane: rec- tangular coordinates, normal and tangential coordinates, and polar coor- dinates. An important lesson to be learned from the study of these coordinate systems is the proper choice of a reference system for a given problem. This choice is usually revealed by the manner in which the mo- tion is generated or by the form in which the data are speciﬁed. Each of the three coordinate systems will now be developed and illustrated. 2/4 Rectangular Coordinates (x-y) This system of coordinates is particularly useful for describing mo- tions where the x- and y-components of acceleration are independently generated or determined. The resulting curvilinear motion is then ob- tained by a vector combination of the x- and y-components of the posi- tion vector, the velocity, and the acceleration. Vector Representation The particle path of Fig. 2/5 is shown again in Fig. 2/7 along with x- and y-axes. The position vector r, the velocity v, and the acceleration a of the particle as developed in Art. 2/3 are represented in Fig. 2/7 to- gether with their x- and y-components. With the aid of the unit vectors i and j, we can write the vectors r, v, and a in terms of their x- and y-components. Thus, r (cid:4) xi (cid:2) yj v (cid:4) r˙ (cid:4) x˙i (cid:2) y˙j a (cid:4) v˙ (cid:4) r¨ (cid:4) x¨i (cid:2) y¨j (2/6) As we differentiate with respect to time, we observe that the time deriv- atives of the unit vectors are zero because their magnitudes and direc- tions remain constant. The scalar values of the components of v and a are merely vx (cid:4) , vy (cid:4) and ax (cid:4) x˙ . (As drawn in Fig. 2/7, ax is in the negative x-direction, so that would be a negative number.) v˙y (cid:4) y¨ (cid:4) , ay (cid:4) x¨ v˙x y˙ x¨ As observed previously, the direction of the velocity is always tan- gent to the path, and from the ﬁgure it is clear that v2 (cid:4) vx 2 (cid:2) vy 2 v (cid:4) (cid:5)vx 2 (cid:2) vy 2 tan (cid:2) (cid:4) vy vx a2 (cid:4) ax 2 (cid:2) ay 2 a (cid:4) (cid:5)ax 2 (cid:2) ay 2 If the angle (cid:2) is measured counterclockwise from the x-axis to v for the configuration of axes shown, then we can also observe that dy/dx (cid:4) tan (cid:2) (cid:4) vy/vx.

Similarly, we combine their ﬁrst derivatives to obtain a. On and the other hand, if the acceleration components ax and ay are given as functions of the time, we can integrate each one separately with re- spect to time, once to obtain vx and vy and again to obtain x (cid:4) ƒ1(t) and y (cid:4) ƒ2(t). Elimination of the time t between these last two parametric equations gives the equation of the curved path y (cid:4) ƒ(x). y¨ x¨ From the foregoing discussion we can see that the rectangular- coordinate representation of curvilinear motion is merely the superposi- tion of the components of two simultaneous rectilinear motions in the x- and y-directions. Therefore, everything covered in Art. 2/2 on rectilin- ear motion can be applied separately to the x-motion and to the y-motion. Projectile Motion An important application of two-dimensional kinematic theory is the problem of projectile motion. For a first treatment of the subject, we neglect aerodynamic drag and the curvature and rotation of the earth, and we assume that the altitude change is small enough so that the acceleration due to gravity can be considered constant. With these assumptions, rectangular coordinates are useful for the trajectory analysis. For the axes shown in Fig. 2/8, the acceleration components are ax (cid:4) 0 ay (cid:4) (cid:5)g Integration of these accelerations follows the results obtained previ- ously in Art. 2/2a for constant acceleration and yields vx (cid:4) (vx)0 x (cid:4) x0 (cid:2) (vx)0 t vy 2 (cid:4) (vy)0 vy (cid:4) (vy)0 (cid:5) gt y (cid:4) y0 (cid:2) (vy)0 t (cid:5) 1 2 (cid:5) 2g(y (cid:5) y0) 2 gt2 In all these expressions, the subscript zero denotes initial conditions, frequently taken as those at launch where, for the case illustrated, y (vy)0 = v0 sin θ v0 θ (vx)0 = v0 cos θ v vx vy g vx v vy x Figure 2/8 c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 45 Article 2/4 Rectangular Coordinates (x-y) 45 x0 (cid:4) y0 (cid:4) 0. Note that the quantity g is taken to be positive throughout this text. We can see that the x- and y-motions are independent for the simple projectile conditions under consideration. Elimination of the time t be- tween the x- and y-displacement equations shows the path to be parabolic (see Sample Problem 2/6). If we were to introduce a drag force which de- pends on the speed squared (for example), then the x- and y-motions would be coupled (interdependent), and the trajectory would be nonparabolic. When the projectile motion involves large velocities and high alti- tudes, to obtain accurate results we must account for the shape of the projectile, the variation of g with altitude, the variation of the air den- sity with altitude, and the rotation of the earth. These factors introduce considerable complexity into the motion equations, and numerical inte- gration of the acceleration equations is usually necessary. i y z a h d v a D w e d n A r This stroboscopic photograph of a bouncing ping-pong ball suggests not only the parabolic nature of the path, but also the fact that the speed is lower near the apex. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 46 46 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 2/5 The curvilinear motion of a particle is defined by vx (cid:4) 50 (cid:5) 16t and y (cid:4) 100 (cid:5) 4t2, where vx is in meters per second, y is in meters, and t is in seconds. It is also known that x (cid:4) 0 when t (cid:4) 0. Plot the path of the particle and deter- mine its velocity and acceleration when the position y (cid:4) 0 is reached. Solution. The x-coordinate is obtained by integrating the expression for vx, and the x-component of the acceleration is obtained by differentiating vx.

Note espe- cially that the acceleration vector has a component that points toward the in- side of the curved path. We concluded from our diagram in Fig. 2/5 that it is impossible for the acceleration to have a component that points toward the out- side of the curve. c02.qxd 2/9/12 12:04 PM Page 47 SAMPLE PROBLEM 2/6 A team of engineering students designs a medium-size catapult v0 (cid:4) 80 ft/sec, which launches 8-lb steel spheres.

These coor- dinates provide a very natural description for curvilinear motion and are frequently the most direct and convenient coordinates to use. The n- and t-coordinates are considered to move along the path with the par- ticle, as seen in Fig. 2/9 where the particle advances from A to B to C. The positive direction for n at any position is always taken toward the center of curvature of the path. As seen from Fig. 2/9, the positive n-direction will shift from one side of the curve to the other side if the curvature changes direction. Velocity and Acceleration We now use the coordinates n and t to describe the velocity v and acceleration a which were introduced in Art. 2/3 for the curvilinear mo- tion of a particle. For this purpose, we introduce unit vectors en in the n-direction and et in the t-direction, as shown in Fig. 2/10a for the posi- tion of the particle at point A on its path. During a differential incre- ment of time dt, the particle moves a differential distance ds along the curve from A to A(cid:2). With the radius of curvature of the path at this posi- tion designated by (cid:6), we see that ds (cid:4) (cid:6) d(cid:7), where (cid:7) is in radians. It is unnecessary to consider the differential change in (cid:6) between A and A(cid:2) because a higher-order term would be introduced which disappears in the limit. Thus, the magnitude of the velocity can be written v (cid:4) ds/dt (cid:4) (cid:6) d(cid:7)/dt, and we can write the velocity as the vector v (cid:4) vet (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:7)˙et (2/7) The acceleration a of the particle was defined in Art. 2/3 as a (cid:4) dv/dt, and we observed from Fig. 2/5 that the acceleration is a vector which reflects both the change in magnitude and the change in direc- tion of v. We now differentiate v in Eq. 2/7 by applying the ordinary rule for the differentiation of the product of a scalar and a vector* and get a (cid:4) dv dt (cid:4) d(vet) dt (cid:4) ve˙t (cid:2) v˙et (2/8) where the unit vector et now has a nonzero derivative because its direc- tion changes. e˙t To ﬁnd we analyze the change in et during a differential incre- ment of motion as the particle moves from A to A(cid:2) in Fig. 2/10a. The unit vector et correspondingly changes to , and the vector difference det is shown in part b of the ﬁgure. The vector det in the limit has a magnitude equal to the length of the arc (cid:6)et(cid:6) d(cid:7) (cid:4) d(cid:7) obtained by swinging the unit vector et through the angle d(cid:7) expressed in radians. e(cid:2) t *See Art. C/7 of Appendix C. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 55 Article 2/5 Normal and Tangential Coordinates (n-t) 55 The direction of det is given by en. Thus, we can write det (cid:4) en d(cid:7). Dividing by d(cid:7) gives det d(cid:7) (cid:4) en Dividing by dt gives det/dt (cid:4) (d(cid:7)/dt)en, which can be written e˙t (cid:4) (cid:7)˙en (2/9) With the substitution of Eq. 2/9 and (cid:7)˙ from the relation v (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:7)˙, Eq. 2/8 for the acceleration becomes a (cid:4) v2 (cid:6) en (cid:2) v˙et (2/10) where an (cid:4) v2 (cid:6) (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:7)˙2 (cid:4) v(cid:7)˙ at (cid:4) v˙ (cid:4) s¨ a (cid:4) (cid:5)an 2 (cid:2) at 2 v˙ We stress that is the time rate of change of the speed v.

(cid:6)(cid:7)¨ (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:6)˙. Geometric Interpretation v(cid:7)˙ Full understanding of Eq. 2/10 comes only when we clearly see the geometry of the physical changes it describes. Figure 2/10c shows the ve- locity vector v when the particle is at A and v(cid:2) when it is at A(cid:2). The vector change in the velocity is dv, which establishes the direction of the accelera- tion a. The n-component of dv is labeled dvn, and in the limit its magni- tude equals the length of the arc generated by swinging the vector v as a radius through the angle d(cid:7). Thus, (cid:6)dvn(cid:6) (cid:4) v d(cid:7) and the n-component of acceleration is an (cid:4) (cid:6)dvn(cid:6)/dt (cid:4) v(d(cid:7)/dt) (cid:4) as before. The t-component of dv is labeled dvt, and its magnitude is simply the change dv in the magni- tude or length of the velocity vector. Therefore, the t-component of accel- eration is at (cid:4) dv/dt (cid:4) (cid:4) as before. The acceleration vectors resulting from the corresponding vector changes in velocity are shown in Fig. 2/10c. It is especially important to observe that the normal component of acceleration an is always directed toward the center of curvature C. The tangential component of acceleration, on the other hand, will be in the positive t-direction of motion if the speed v is increasing and in the nega- tive t-direction if the speed is decreasing. In Fig. 2/11 are shown schematic representations of the variation in the acceleration vector for a particle moving from A to B with (a) increasing speed and (b) decreas- ing speed. At an inﬂection point on the curve, the normal acceleration v2/(cid:6) goes to zero because (cid:6) becomes inﬁnite. v˙ s¨ c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 56 56 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles B B A Speed increasing (a) A Speed decreasing (b) Acceleration vectors for particle moving from A to B Figure 2/11 t v at P r n an O θ Circular Motion Circular motion is an important special case of plane curvilinear motion where the radius of curvature (cid:6) becomes the constant radius r of the circle and the angle (cid:7) is replaced by the angle (cid:2) measured from any convenient radial reference to OP, Fig. 2/12.

Polar coordinates are particularly useful when a motion is constrained through the control of a radial distance and an angular po- sition or when an unconstrained motion is observed by measurements of a radial distance and an angular position. Figure 2/13a shows the polar coordinates r and (cid:2) which locate a particle traveling on a curved path. An arbitrary fixed line, such as the x-axis, is used as a reference for the measurement of (cid:2). Unit vectors er and e(cid:2) are established in the positive r- and (cid:2)-directions, respectively. The position vector r to the particle at A has a magnitude equal to the radial distance r and a direction specified by the unit vector er. Thus, we express the location of the particle at A by the vector r (cid:4) rer Time Derivatives of the Unit Vectors r˙ e˙(cid:2) e˙r and in exactly the same way we derived To differentiate this relation with respect to time to obtain v (cid:4) and a (cid:4) we need expressions for the time derivatives of both unit vectors er v˙, and e(cid:2). We obtain in the preceding article. During time dt the coordinate directions rotate through the angle d(cid:2), and the unit vectors also rotate through the same angle from er and e(cid:2) to , as shown in Fig. 2/13b. We note that the vec- tor change der is in the plus (cid:2)-direction and that de(cid:2) is in the minus r-direction. Because their magnitudes in the limit are equal to the unit vector as radius times the angle d(cid:2) in radians, we can write them as der (cid:4) e(cid:2) d(cid:2) and de(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:5)er d(cid:2). If we divide these equations by d(cid:2), we have and e(cid:2) r e(cid:2)(cid:2) e˙t der d(cid:2) (cid:4) e(cid:2) and de(cid:2) d(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:5)er If, on the other hand, we divide them by dt, we have der/dt (cid:4) (d(cid:2)/dt)e(cid:2) and de(cid:2)/dt (cid:4) (cid:5)(d(cid:2)/dt)er, or simply e˙r (cid:4) (cid:2)˙e(cid:2) and e˙(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:2)˙er (2/12) Velocity We are now ready to differentiate r (cid:4) rer with respect to time.

This form for a(cid:2) will be useful when we treat the angular momentum of par- ticles in the next chapter. Geometric Interpretation The terms in Eq. 2/14 can be best understood when the geometry of the physical changes can be clearly seen. For this purpose, Fig. 2/14a is developed to show the velocity vectors and their r- and (cid:2)-components at position A and at position A(cid:2) after an inﬁnitesimal movement. Each of these components undergoes a change in magnitude and direction as shown in Fig. 2/14b. In this ﬁgure we see the following changes: (a) Magnitude Change of vr . This change is simply the increase in and the corresponding acceleration term is length of vr or dvr (cid:2) dr˙/dt r¨ (cid:2) in the positive r-direction. dr˙, (b) Direction Change of vr . The magnitude of this change is seen and its contribution to the accelera- r˙ d(cid:2), from the ﬁgure to be vr d(cid:2) (cid:2) tion becomes r˙ d(cid:2)/dt r˙(cid:2)˙ (cid:2) which is in the positive (cid:2)-direction. (c) Magnitude Change of v(cid:2). This term is the change in length of r˙(cid:2)˙ d(r (cid:2)˙), and its contribution to the acceleration is d(r (cid:2)˙)/dt r (cid:2)¨ (cid:3) (cid:2) v(cid:2) or and is in the positive (cid:2)-direction.

We see that the term is the acceleration which the particle would have along the radius in the absence of a change in (cid:2). The term (cid:5)r (cid:2)˙2 is the normal component of acceleration if r were constant, as in circular motion. The term is the tangential acceleration which the particle would have if r were constant, but is only a part of the accelera- tion due to the change in magnitude of v(cid:2) when r is variable. Finally, the is composed of two effects. The ﬁrst effect comes from that term of v(cid:2) due to the change in r, portion of the change in magnitude and the second effect comes from the change in direction of vr. The term 2r˙(cid:2)˙ represents, therefore, a combination of changes and is not so easily perceived as are the other acceleration terms. d(r (cid:2)˙) 2r˙(cid:2)˙ r (cid:2)¨ Note the difference between the vector change dvr in vr and the change dvr in the magnitude of vr. Similarly, the vector change dv(cid:2) is not the same as the change dv(cid:2) in the magnitude of v(cid:2). When we divide these changes by dt to obtain expressions for the derivatives, we see clearly that the magnitude of the derivative (cid:6)dvr/dt(cid:6) and the derivative of the magnitude dvr/dt are not the same. Note also that ar is not and that a(cid:2) is not v˙r v˙(cid:2).

If a has a component normal to the path, we know from our analy- sis of n- and t-components in Art. 2/5 that the sense of the n-component must be toward the center of curvature.

Thus, ar (cid:4) (cid:5)an for circular motion centered at the origin of the polar coordinates. The expressions for ar and a(cid:2) in scalar form can also be obtained by direct differentiation of the coordinate relations x (cid:4) r cos (cid:2) and y (cid:4) r sin (cid:2) to obtain ax (cid:4) and ay (cid:4) Each of these rectangular components of ac- celeration can then be resolved into r- and (cid:2)-components which, when combined, will yield the expressions of Eq. 2/14. y¨. x¨ c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 69 Article 2/6 Polar Coordinates (r-(cid:2)) 69 SAMPLE PROBLEM 2/9 Rotation of the radially slotted arm is governed by (cid:2) (cid:4) 0.2t (cid:2) 0.02t3, where (cid:2) is in radians and t is in seconds.

Three coordinate systems, rectangular (x-y-z), cylindrical (r-(cid:2)-z), and spherical (R-(cid:2)-(cid:3)), are commonly used to describe this motion. These systems are indicated in Fig. 2/16, which also shows the unit vectors for the three co- ordinate systems.* Before describing the use of these coordinate systems, we note that a path-variable description, using n- and t-coordinates, which we devel- oped in Art. 2/5, can be applied in the osculating plane shown in Fig. 2/1. We deﬁned this plane as the plane which contains the curve at the location in question. We see that the velocity v, which is along the tan- gent t to the curve, lies in the osculating plane. The acceleration a also lies in the osculating plane. As in the case of plane motion, it has a com- ponent at (cid:4) tangent to the path due to the change in magnitude of the velocity and a component an (cid:4) v2/(cid:6) normal to the curve due to the change in direction of the velocity. As before, (cid:6) is the radius of curva- ture of the path at the point in question and is measured in the osculat- ing plane. This description of motion, which is natural and direct for many plane-motion problems, is awkward to use for space motion be- cause the osculating plane continually shifts its orientation. We will conﬁne our attention, therefore, to the three ﬁxed coordinate systems shown in Fig. 2/16. v˙ Rectangular Coordinates (x-y-z) The extension from two to three dimensions offers no particular dif- ﬁculty. We merely add the z-coordinate and its two time derivatives to the two-dimensional expressions of Eqs. 2/6 so that the position vector R, the velocity v, and the acceleration a become R (cid:4) xi (cid:2) yj (cid:2) zk v (cid:4) R˙ (cid:4) x˙i (cid:2) y˙j (cid:2) z˙k a (cid:4) v˙ (cid:4) R¨ (cid:4) x¨i (cid:2) y¨j (cid:2) z¨k (2/15) Note that in three dimensions we are using R in place of r for the posi- tion vector. Cylindrical Coordinates (r-(cid:2)-z) If we understand the polar-coordinate description of plane motion, then there should be no difﬁculty with cylindrical coordinates because all that is required is the addition of the z-coordinate and its two time derivatives. The position vector R to the particle for cylindrical coordi- nates is simply R (cid:4) rer (cid:2) zk *In a variation of spherical coordinates commonly used, angle (cid:3) is replaced by its complement. c02.qxd 2/13/12 2:18 PM Page 80 80 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles In place of Eq. 2/13 for plane motion, we can write the velocity as v (cid:2) r˙er (cid:3) r (cid:2)˙e(cid:2) (cid:3) z˙k (2/16) where vr (cid:2) v(cid:2) (cid:2) vz (cid:2) v (cid:2) r˙ r (cid:2)˙ z˙ (cid:2)vr 2 (cid:3) v(cid:2) 2 (cid:3) vz 2 Similarly, the acceleration is written by adding the z-component to Eq. 2/14, which gives us a (cid:2) (r¨ (cid:4) r (cid:2)˙2)er (cid:3) (r (cid:2)¨ (cid:3) 2r˙(cid:2)˙)e(cid:2) (cid:3) z¨k (2/17) where ar (cid:2) r¨ (cid:4) r (cid:2)˙2 a(cid:2) (cid:2) r (cid:2)¨ (cid:3) 2r˙(cid:2)˙ (cid:2) 1 r d dt (r2 (cid:2)˙) az (cid:2) a (cid:2) z¨ (cid:2)ar 2 (cid:3) a(cid:2) 2 (cid:3) az 2 Whereas the unit vectors er and e(cid:2) have nonzero time derivatives due to the changes in their directions, we note that the unit vector k in the z-direction remains fixed in direction and therefore has a zero time derivative. Spherical Coordinates (R-(cid:2)-(cid:3)) Spherical coordinates R, (cid:2), (cid:3) are utilized when a radial distance and two angles are utilized to specify the position of a particle, as in the case of radar measurements, for example. Derivation of the expression for the velocity v is easily obtained, but the expression for the acceleration a is more complex because of the added geometry. Consequently, only the results will be cited here.* First we designate unit vectors eR, e(cid:2), e(cid:3) as shown in Fig. 2/16. Note that the unit vector eR is in the direction in which the particle P would move if R increases but (cid:2) and (cid:3) are held con- stant. The unit vector e(cid:2) is in the direction in which P would move if (cid:2) increases while R and (cid:3) are held constant. Finally, the unit vector e(cid:3) is in the direction in which P would move if (cid:3) increases while R and (cid:2) are held constant. The resulting expressions for v and a are v (cid:2) vReR (cid:3) v(cid:2)e(cid:2) (cid:3) v(cid:3)e(cid:3) (2/18) where R˙ R (cid:2)˙ cos (cid:3) vR (cid:2) v(cid:2) (cid:2) v(cid:3) (cid:2) R(cid:3)˙ *For a complete derivation of v and a in spherical coordinates, see the ﬁrst author’s book Dynamics, 2nd edition, 1971, or SI Version, 1975 (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 81 and where aR (cid:4) a(cid:2) (cid:4) Article 2/7 Space Curvilinear Motion 81 a (cid:4) aReR (cid:2) a(cid:2)e(cid:2) (cid:2) a(cid:3)e(cid:3) (2/19) R¨ (cid:5) R(cid:3)˙2 (cid:5) R (cid:2)˙2 cos2 (cid:3) cos (cid:3) R d dt (R2 (cid:2)˙) (cid:5) 2R (cid:2)˙(cid:3)˙ sin (cid:3) a(cid:3) (cid:4) 1 R d dt (R2(cid:3)˙) (cid:2) R (cid:2)˙2 sin (cid:3) cos (cid:3) Linear algebraic transformations between any two of the three coordinate-system expressions for velocity or acceleration can be devel- oped.

The dis- placements, velocities, and accelerations so determined are termed ab- solute. It is not always possible or convenient, however, to use a fixed set of axes to describe or to measure motion. In addition, there are many engineering problems for which the analysis of motion is simpli- fied by using measurements made with respect to a moving reference system. These measurements, when combined with the absolute mo- tion of the moving coordinate system, enable us to determine the ab- solute motion in question. This approach is called a relative-motion analysis. Choice of Coordinate System The motion of the moving coordinate system is speciﬁed with re- spect to a ﬁxed coordinate system. Strictly speaking, in Newtonian me- chanics, this ﬁxed system is the primary inertial system, which is assumed to have no motion in space. For engineering purposes, the ﬁxed system may be taken as any system whose absolute motion is negligible for the problem at hand. For most earthbound engineering problems, it is sufﬁciently precise to take for the ﬁxed reference system a set of axes attached to the earth, in which case we neglect the motion of the earth. For the motion of satellites around the earth, a nonrotating coordinate system is chosen with its origin on the axis of rotation of the earth. For interplanetary travel, a nonrotating coordinate system ﬁxed to the sun would be used. Thus, the choice of the ﬁxed system depends on the type of problem involved. We will conﬁne our attention in this article to moving reference systems which translate but do not rotate. Motion measured in rotating systems will be discussed in Art. 5/7 of Chapter 5 on rigid-body kine- matics, where this approach ﬁnds special but important application. We will also conﬁne our attention here to relative-motion analysis for plane motion. Vector Representation Now consider two particles A and B which may have separate curvilinear motions in a given plane or in parallel planes, Fig. 2/17. We will arbitrarily attach the origin of a set of translating (nonrotating) axes x-y to particle B and observe the motion of A from our moving po- sition on B. The position vector of A as measured relative to the frame x-y is rA/B (cid:4) xi (cid:2) yj, where the subscript notation “A/B” means “A rel- ative to B” or “A with respect to B.” The unit vectors along the x- and y-axes are i and j, and x and y are the coordinates of A measured in the x-y frame. The absolute position of B is defined by the vector rB mea- sured from the origin of the fixed axes X-Y. The absolute position of A is seen, therefore, to be determined by the vector . c n I , s e g a m I k e r t k c o t S Relative motion is a critical issue in the midair refueling of aircraft.

Thus, r˙A (cid:4) r˙B (cid:2) r˙A/B or vA (cid:4) vB (cid:2) vA/B (2/20) r¨A (cid:4) r¨B (cid:2) r¨A/B or aA (cid:4) aB (cid:2) aA/B (2/21) x˙i r˙A/B (cid:4) vA/B (cid:4) In Eq. 2/20 the velocity which we observe A to have from our position This at B attached to the moving axes x-y is term is the velocity of A with respect to B. Similarly, in Eq. 2/21 the acceleration which we observe A to have from our nonrotating posi- y¨j. tion on B is This term is the acceleration of A with respect to B. We note that the unit vectors i and j have zero de- rivatives because their directions as well as their magnitudes remain unchanged. (Later when we discuss rotating reference axes, we must account for the derivatives of the unit vectors when they change di- rection.) v˙A/B r¨A/B y˙j. x¨i (cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:2) Equation 2/20 (or 2/21) states that the absolute velocity (or acceler- ation) of A equals the absolute velocity (or acceleration) of B plus, vecto- rially, the velocity (or acceleration) of A relative to B. The relative term is the velocity (or acceleration) measurement which an observer at- tached to the moving coordinate system x-y would make. We can express the relative-motion terms in whatever coordinate system is convenient— rectangular, normal and tangential, or polar—and the formulations in the preceding articles can be used for this purpose. The appropriate ﬁxed system of the previous articles becomes the moving system in the present article. Additional Considerations The selection of the moving point B for attachment of the reference coordinate system is arbitrary. As shown in Fig. 2/18, point A could be used just as well for the attachment of the moving system, in which case the three corresponding relative-motion equations for position, velocity, and acceleration are rB (cid:4) rA (cid:2) rB/A vB (cid:4) vA (cid:2) vB/A aB (cid:4) aA (cid:2) aB/A It is seen, therefore, that rB/A (cid:4) (cid:5)rA/B, vB/A (cid:4) (cid:5)vA/B, and aB/A (cid:4) (cid:5)aA/B. In relative-motion analysis, it is important to realize that the ac- celeration of a particle as observed in a translating system x-y is the same as that observed in a fixed system X-Y if the moving system has a constant velocity. This conclusion broadens the application of New- ton’s second law of motion (Chapter 3). We conclude, consequently, that a set of axes which has a constant absolute velocity may be used in place of a “fixed” system for the determination of accelerations. A translating reference system which has no acceleration is called an in- ertial system. y A rB/A x rA rB B X Figure 2/18 Y O c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 90 90 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 2/13 Passengers in the jet transport A ﬂying east at a speed of 800 km/h observe a second jet plane B that passes under the transport in horizontal ﬂight. Al- though the nose of B is pointed in the 45(cid:2) northeast direction, plane B appears to the passengers in A to be moving away from the transport at the 60(cid:2) angle as shown. Determine the true velocity of B. Solution. The moving reference axes x-y are attached to A, from which the relative observations are made. We write, therefore, (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) vB (cid:4) vA (cid:2) vB/A Next we identify the knowns and unknowns. The velocity vA is given in both mag- nitude and direction. The 60(cid:2) direction of vB/A, the velocity which B appears to have to the moving observers in A, is known, and the true velocity of B is in the 45(cid:2) direction in which it is heading. The two remaining unknowns are the magni- tudes of vB and vB/A. We may solve the vector equation in any one of three ways. (I) Graphical. We start the vector sum at some point P by drawing vA to a convenient scale and then construct a line through the tip of vA with the known direction of vB/A. The known direction of vB is then drawn through P, and the in- tersection C yields the unique solution enabling us to complete the vector trian- gle and scale off the unknown magnitudes, which are found to be vB/A (cid:4) 586 km/h and vB (cid:4) 717 km/h Ans.

It is worth noting the solution of this problem from the viewpoint of an observer in B. With reference axes attached to B, we would write vA (cid:4) vB (cid:2) vA/B. The ap- parent velocity of A as observed by B is then vA/B, which is the negative of vB/A. 60° B y 45° A x Helpful Hints (cid:3) We treat each airplane as a particle.

Caution: So far we are only prepared to handle motion relative to nonrotating axes. If we had attached the reference axes rigidly to car B, they would rotate with the car, and we would ﬁnd that the velocity and acceleration terms relative to the rotating axes are not the negative of those measured from the nonrotating axes moving with A.

In such cases it is necessary to account for these constraints in order to determine the re- spective motions of the particles. One Degree of Freedom x A r2 A′ B′ C b y r1 B Consider ﬁrst the very simple system of two interconnected parti- cles A and B shown in Fig. 2/19. It should be quite evident by inspec- tion that the horizontal motion of A is twice the vertical motion of B. Nevertheless we will use this example to illustrate the method of analy- sis which applies to more complex situations where the results cannot be easily obtained by inspection. The motion of B is clearly the same as that of the center of its pulley, so we establish position coordinates y and x measured from a convenient ﬁxed datum. The total length of the cable is L (cid:4) x (cid:2) (cid:2) 2y (cid:2) (cid:8)r1 (cid:2) b (cid:8)r2 2 Figure 2/19 With L, r2, r1, and b all constant, the ﬁrst and second time derivatives of the equation give 0 (cid:4) x˙ (cid:2) 2y˙ 0 (cid:4) x¨ (cid:2) 2y¨ or or 0 (cid:4) vA (cid:2) 2vB 0 (cid:4) aA (cid:2) 2aB The velocity and acceleration constraint equations indicate that, for the coordinates selected, the velocity of A must have a sign which is op- posite to that of the velocity of B, and similarly for the accelerations. The constraint equations are valid for the motion of the system in either direction. We emphasize that vA (cid:4) is positive to the left and that vB (cid:4) x˙ y˙ is positive down. Because the results do not depend on the lengths or pulley radii, we should be able to analyze the motion without considering them. In the lower-left portion of Fig. 2/19 is shown an enlarged view of the horizon- tal diameter A(cid:2)B(cid:2)C(cid:2) of the lower pulley at an instant of time. Clearly, A(cid:2) and A have the same motion magnitudes, as do B and B(cid:2). During an inﬁnitesimal motion of A(cid:2), it is easy to see from the triangle that B(cid:2) moves half as far as A(cid:2) because point C as a point on the ﬁxed portion of the cable momentarily has no motion. Thus, with differentiation by time in mind, we can obtain the velocity and acceleration magnitude re- lationships by inspection. The pulley, in effect, is a wheel which rolls on the ﬁxed vertical cable. (The kinematics of a rolling wheel will be treated more extensively in Chapter 5 on rigid-body motion.) The sys- tem of Fig. 2/19 is said to have one degree of freedom since only one variable, either x or y, is needed to specify the positions of all parts of the system. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 99 Article 2/9 Constrained Motion of Connected Particles 99 Two Degrees of Freedom The system with two degrees of freedom is shown in Fig. 2/20. Here the positions of the lower cylinder and pulley C depend on the separate speciﬁcations of the two coordinates yA and yB. The lengths of the cables attached to cylinders A and B can be written, respectively, as LA (cid:4) yA (cid:2) 2yD (cid:2) constant LB (cid:4) yB (cid:2) yC (cid:2) (yC (cid:5) yD) (cid:2) constant and their time derivatives are 0 (cid:4) y˙A (cid:2) 2y˙D 0 (cid:4) y¨A (cid:2) 2y¨D and and 0 (cid:4) y˙B (cid:2) 2y˙C (cid:5) y˙D 0 (cid:4) y¨B (cid:2) 2y¨C (cid:5) y¨D yB yC B yA yD A D C Eliminating the terms in y˙D and y¨D gives Figure 2/20 y˙A (cid:2) 2y˙B (cid:2) 4y˙C (cid:4) 0 y¨A (cid:2) 2y¨B (cid:2) 4y¨C (cid:4) 0 or or vA (cid:2) 2vB (cid:2) 4vC (cid:4) 0 aA (cid:2) 2aB (cid:2) 4aC (cid:4) 0 It is clearly impossible for the signs of all three terms to be positive si- multaneously. So, for example, if both A and B have downward (posi- tive) velocities, then C will have an upward (negative) velocity. These results can also be found by inspection of the motions of the two pulleys at C and D. For an increment dyA (with yB held ﬁxed), the center of D moves up an amount dyA/2, which causes an upward move- ment dyA/4 of the center of C. For an increment dyB (with yA held ﬁxed), the center of C moves up a distance dyB/2. A combination of the two movements gives an upward movement (cid:5)dyC (cid:4) dyA 4 (cid:2) dyB 2 so that (cid:5)vC (cid:4) vA/4 (cid:2) vB/2 as before. Visualization of the actual geometry of the motion is an important ability. A second type of constraint where the direction of the connecting member changes with the motion is illustrated in the second of the two sample problems which follow. c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 100 100 Chapter 2 Kinematics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 2/15 In the pulley conﬁguration shown, cylinder A has a downward velocity of 0.3 m/s. Determine the velocity of B. Solve in two ways. Solution (I). The centers of the pulleys at A and B are located by the coordi- nates yA and yB measured from ﬁxed positions. The total constant length of cable in the pulley system is yB L (cid:4) 3yB (cid:2) 2yA (cid:2) constants where the constants account for the ﬁxed lengths of cable in contact with the cir- cumferences of the pulleys and the constant vertical separation between the two upper left-hand pulleys. Differentiation with time gives C yA A B (cid:3) (cid:4) Substitution of vA (cid:4) y˙A 0 (cid:4) 3y˙B (cid:2) 2y˙A y˙B gives (cid:4) 0.3 m/s and vB (cid:4) or 0 (cid:4) 3(vB) (cid:2) 2(0.3) vB (cid:4) (cid:5)0.2 m/s Ans. Solution (II). An enlarged diagram of the pulleys at A, B, and C is shown. During a differential movement dsA of the center of pulley A, the left end of its horizontal diameter has no motion since it is attached to the ﬁxed part of the cable. Therefore, the right-hand end has a movement of 2dsA as shown. This movement is transmitted to the left-hand end of the horizontal diameter of the pulley at B. Further, from pulley C with its ﬁxed center, we see that the displace- ments on each side are equal and opposite. Thus, for pulley B, the right-hand end of the diameter has a downward displacement equal to the upward displace- ment dsB of its center. By inspection of the geometry, we conclude that 2dsA (cid:4) 3dsB or dsB (cid:4) 2 3dsA Dividing by dt gives (cid:6)vB vA (cid:4) 2 (cid:6) (cid:4) 2 3 3 (0.3) (cid:4) 0.2 m/s (upward) Ans.

The concepts developed in this chapter form the basis for much of dynamics, and it is important to review and master this material before proceeding to the following chapters. By far the most important concept in Chapter 2 is the time deriva- tive of a vector. The time derivative of a vector depends on direction change as well as magnitude change. As we proceed in our study of dy- namics, we will need to examine the time derivatives of vectors other than position and velocity vectors, and the principles and procedures de- veloped in Chapter 2 will be useful for this purpose. Categories of Motion The following categories of motion have been examined in this chapter: 1. Rectilinear motion (one coordinate) 2. Plane curvilinear motion (two coordinates) 3. Space curvilinear motion (three coordinates) In general, the geometry of a given problem enables us to identify the category readily. One exception to this categorization is encountered when only the magnitudes of the motion quantities measured along the path are of interest. In this event, we can use the single distance coordi- nate measured along the curved path, together with its scalar time de- rivatives giving the speed and the tangential acceleration (cid:6) s˙ (cid:6) s¨. Plane motion is easier to generate and control, particularly in ma- chinery, than space motion, and thus a large fraction of our motion problems come under the plane curvilinear or rectilinear categories. Use of Fixed Axes We commonly describe motion or make motion measurements with respect to ﬁxed reference axes (absolute motion) and moving axes (rela- tive motion). The acceptable choice of the ﬁxed axes depends on the problem. Axes attached to the surface of the earth are sufﬁciently “ﬁxed” for most engineering problems, although important exceptions include earth–satellite and interplanetary motion, accurate projectile trajecto- ries, navigation, and other problems. The equations of relative motion discussed in Chapter 2 are restricted to translating reference axes. Choice of Coordinates The choice of coordinates is of prime importance. We have devel- oped the description of motion using the following coordinates: 1. Rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates (x-y) and (x-y-z) 2. Normal and tangential coordinates (n-t) 3. Polar coordinates (r-(cid:2)) c02.qxd 2/8/12 7:11 PM Page 107 4. Cylindrical coordinates (r-(cid:2)-z) 5. Spherical coordinates (R-(cid:2)-(cid:3)) When the coordinates are not speciﬁed, the appropriate choice usually depends on how the motion is generated or measured. Thus, for a parti- cle which slides radially along a rotating rod, polar coordinates are the natural ones to use. Radar tracking calls for polar or spherical coordi- nates. When measurements are made along a curved path, normal and tangential coordinates are indicated. An x-y plotter clearly involves rec- tangular coordinates. Figure 2/21 is a composite representation of the x-y, n-t, and r-(cid:2) co- ordinate descriptions of the velocity v and acceleration a for curvilinear motion in a plane. It is frequently essential to transpose motion descrip- tion from one set of coordinates to another, and Fig. 2/21 contains the information necessary for that transition. Approximations Making appropriate approximations is one of the most important abilities you can acquire. The assumption of constant acceleration is valid when the forces which cause the acceleration do not vary apprecia- bly. When motion data are acquired experimentally, we must utilize the nonexact data to acquire the best possible description, often with the aid of graphical or numerical approximations. y Choice of Mathematical Method We frequently have a choice of solution using scalar algebra, vector algebra, trigonometric geometry, or graphical geometry. All of these methods have been illustrated, and all are important to learn. The choice of method will depend on the geometry of the problem, how the motion data are given, and the accuracy desired. Mechanics by its very nature is geometric, so you are encouraged to develop facility in sketching vector relationships, both as an aid to the disclosure of appropriate geometric and trigonometric relations and as a means of solving vector equations graphically. Geometric portrayal is the most direct representation of the vast majority of mechanics problems.

Kinetics is the study of the relations between unbalanced forces and the resulting changes in motion. In Chapter 3 we will study the kinetics of particles. This topic requires that we combine our knowledge of the properties of forces, which we developed in statics, and the kinematics of particle motion just covered in Chapter 2. With the aid of Newton’s second law, we can combine these two topics and solve engineering problems involving force, mass, and motion. The three general approaches to the solution of kinetics problems are: (A) direct application of Newton’s second law (called the force- mass-acceleration method), (B) use of work and energy principles, and 117 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 118 118 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles (C) solution by impulse and momentum methods. Each approach has its special characteristics and advantages, and Chapter 3 is subdivided into Sections A, B, and C, according to these three methods of solution. In addition, a fourth section, Section D, treats special applications and combinations of the three basic approaches. Before proceeding, you should review carefully the deﬁnitions and concepts of Chapter 1, be- cause they are fundamental to the developments which follow. SECTION A FORCE, MASS, AND ACCELERATION 3/2 Newton’s Second Law The basic relation between force and acceleration is found in New- ton’s second law, Eq. 1/1, the veriﬁcation of which is entirely experi- mental. We now describe the fundamental meaning of this law by considering an ideal experiment in which force and acceleration are as- sumed to be measured without error. We subject a mass particle to the action of a single force F1, and we measure the acceleration a1 of the particle in the primary inertial system.* The ratio F1/a1 of the magni- tudes of the force and the acceleration will be some number C1 whose value depends on the units used for measurement of force and accelera- tion. We then repeat the experiment by subjecting the same particle to a different force F2 and measuring the corresponding acceleration a2. The ratio F2/a2 of the magnitudes will again produce a number C2. The experiment is repeated as many times as desired. We draw two important conclusions from the results of these exper- iments. First, the ratios of applied force to corresponding acceleration all equal the same number, provided the units used for measurement are not changed in the experiments. Thus, F1 a1 (cid:2) F2 a2 (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) F a (cid:2) C, a constant We conclude that the constant C is a measure of some invariable property of the particle. This property is the inertia of the particle, which is its resistance to rate of change of velocity. For a particle of high inertia (large C), the acceleration will be small for a given force F. On the other hand, if the inertia is small, the acceleration will be large. The mass m is used as a quantitative measure of inertia, and therefore, we may write the expression C (cid:2) km, where k is a constant introduced to account for the units used. Thus, we may express the relation obtained from the experiments as F (cid:2) kma (3/1) *The primary inertial system or astronomical frame of reference is an imaginary set of ref- erence axes which are assumed to have no translation or rotation in space. See Art. 1/2, Chapter 1. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 119 Article 3/2 Newton’s Second Law 119 where F is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the particle of mass m, and a is the magnitude of the resulting acceleration of the particle. The second conclusion we draw from this ideal experiment is that the acceleration is always in the direction of the applied force. Thus, Eq. 3/1 becomes a vector relation and may be written F (cid:2) kma (3/2) Although an actual experiment cannot be performed in the ideal manner described, the same conclusions have been drawn from countless accurately performed experiments. One of the most accurate checks is given by the precise prediction of the motions of planets based on Eq. 3/2. Inertial System Although the results of the ideal experiment are obtained for mea- surements made relative to the “ﬁxed” primary inertial system, they are equally valid for measurements made with respect to any nonrotating reference system which translates with a constant velocity with respect to the primary system. From our study of relative motion in Art. 2/8, we know that the acceleration measured in a system translating with no ac- celeration is the same as that measured in the primary system. Thus, Newton’s second law holds equally well in a nonaccelerating system, so that we may deﬁne an inertial system as any system in which Eq. 3/2 is valid. If the ideal experiment described were performed on the surface of the earth and all measurements were made relative to a reference sys- tem attached to the earth, the measured results would show a slight dis- crepancy from those predicted by Eq. 3/2, because the measured acceleration would not be the correct absolute acceleration. The discrep- ancy would disappear when we introduced the correction due to the ac- celeration components of the earth. These corrections are negligible for most engineering problems which involve the motions of structures and machines on the surface of the earth. In such cases, the accelerations measured with respect to reference axes attached to the surface of the earth may be treated as “absolute,” and Eq. 3/2 may be applied with negligible error to experiments made on the surface of the earth.* An increasing number of problems occur, particularly in the fields of rocket and spacecraft design, where the acceleration components of the earth are of primary concern. For this work it is essential that the *As an example of the magnitude of the error introduced by neglect of the motion of the earth, consider a particle which is allowed to fall from rest (relative to earth) at a height h above the ground. We can show that the rotation of the earth gives rise to an eastward ac- celeration (Coriolis acceleration) relative to the earth and, neglecting air resistance, that the particle falls to the ground a distance x (cid:2) 2 3 (cid:2)(cid:2)2h3 g cos (cid:3) east of the point on the ground directly under that from which it was dropped. The angular velocity of the earth is (cid:2) (cid:2) 0.729(10(cid:3)4) rad/s, and the latitude, north or south, is (cid:3). At a lat- itude of 45(cid:3) and from a height of 200 m, this eastward deﬂection would be x (cid:2) 43.9 mm. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 120 120 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles fundamental basis of Newton’s second law be thoroughly understood and that the appropriate absolute acceleration components be employed. Before 1905 the laws of Newtonian mechanics had been veriﬁed by innumerable physical experiments and were considered the ﬁnal de- scription of the motion of bodies. The concept of time, considered an ab- solute quantity in the Newtonian theory, received a basically different interpretation in the theory of relativity announced by Einstein in 1905. The new concept called for a complete reformulation of the accepted laws of mechanics. The theory of relativity was subjected to early ridicule, but has been veriﬁed by experiment and is now universally ac- cepted by scientists. Although the difference between the mechanics of Newton and that of Einstein is basic, there is a practical difference in the results given by the two theories only when velocities of the order of the speed of light (300 (cid:4) 106 m/s) are encountered.* Important prob- lems dealing with atomic and nuclear particles, for example, require cal- culations based on the theory of relativity. Systems of Units It is customary to take k equal to unity in Eq. 3/2, thus putting the relation in the usual form of Newton’s second law F (cid:2) ma [1/1] A system of units for which k is unity is known as a kinetic system. Thus, for a kinetic system the units of force, mass, and acceleration are not independent. In SI units, as explained in Art. 1/4, the units of force (newtons, N) are derived by Newton’s second law from the base units of mass (kilograms, kg) times acceleration (meters per second squared, m/s2). Thus, N (cid:2) This system is known as an absolute system since the unit for force is dependent on the absolute value of mass. kg (cid:2) m/s2. In U.S. customary units, on the other hand, the units of mass (slugs) are derived from the units of force (pounds force, lb) divided by acceleration (feet per second squared, ft/sec2). Thus, the mass units are slugs (cid:2) lb-sec2/ft. This system is known as a gravitational system since mass is derived from force as determined from gravitational attraction. For measurements made relative to the rotating earth, the relative value of g should be used. The internationally accepted value of g rela- tive to the earth at sea level and at a latitude of 45(cid:3) is 9.806 65 m/s2. Ex- cept where greater precision is required, the value of 9.81 m/s2 will be used for g. For measurements relative to a nonrotating earth, the ab- solute value of g should be used. At a latitude of 45(cid:3) and at sea level, the absolute value is 9.8236 m/s2. The sea-level variation in both the absolute and relative values of g with latitude is shown in Fig. 1/1 of Art. 1/5. *The theory of relativity demonstrates that there is no such thing as a preferred primary inertial system and that measurements of time made in two coordinate systems which have a velocity relative to one another are different. On this basis, for example, the principles of relativity show that a clock carried by the pilot of a spacecraft traveling around the earth in a circular polar orbit of 644 km altitude at a velocity of 27 080 km/h would be slow com- pared with a clock at the pole by 0.000 001 85 s for each orbit. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 121 Article 3/2 Newton’s Second Law 121 In the U.S. customary system, the standard value of g relative to the rotating earth at sea level and at a latitude of 45(cid:3) is 32.1740 ft/sec2. The corresponding value relative to a nonrotating earth is 32.2230 ft/sec2. Force and Mass Units We need to use both SI units and U.S. customary units, so we must have a clear understanding of the correct force and mass units in each system. These units were explained in Art. 1/4, but it will be helpful to illustrate them here using simple numbers before applying Newton’s second law. Consider, ﬁrst, the free-fall experiment as depicted in Fig. 3/1a where we release an object from rest near the surface of the earth. We allow it to fall freely under the inﬂuence of the force of gravitational attraction W on the body. We call this force the weight of the body. In SI units for a mass m (cid:2) 1 kg, the weight is W (cid:2) 9.81 N, and the corre- sponding downward acceleration a is g (cid:2) 9.81 m/s2. In U.S. customary units for a mass m (cid:2) 1 lbm (1/32.2 slug), the weight is W (cid:2) 1 lbf and the resulting gravitational acceleration is g (cid:2) 32.2 ft/sec2. For a mass m (cid:2) 1 slug (32.2 lbm), the weight is W (cid:2) 32.2 lbf and the acceleration, of course, is also g (cid:2) 32.2 ft/sec2. In Fig. 3/1b we illustrate the proper units with the simplest example where we accelerate an object of mass m along the horizontal with a force F. In SI units (an absolute system), a force F (cid:2) 1 N causes a mass m (cid:2) 1 kg to accelerate at the rate a (cid:2) 1 m/s2. Thus, 1 N (cid:2) 1 In the U.S. customary system (a gravitational system), a force F (cid:2) 1 lbf kg (cid:2) m/s2.

We note that in SI units where the mass is expressed in kilograms (kg), the weight W of the body in newtons (N) is given by W (cid:2) mg, where g (cid:2) 9.81 m/s2. In U.S. customary units, the weight W of a body is expressed in pounds force (lbf), and the mass in slugs (lbf-sec2/ft) is given by m (cid:2) W/g, where g (cid:2) 32.2 ft/sec2. In U.S. customary units, we frequently speak of the weight of a body when we really mean mass. It is entirely proper to specify the mass of a body in pounds (lbm) which must be converted to mass in slugs be- fore substituting into Newton’s second law. Unless otherwise stated, the pound (lb) is normally used as the unit of force (lbf). 3/3 Equation of Motion and Solution of Problems When a particle of mass m is subjected to the action of concurrent forces F1, F2, F3, . . . whose vector sum is ΣF, Eq. 1/1 becomes ΣF (cid:2) ma (3/3) When applying Eq. 3/3 to solve problems, we usually express it in scalar component form with the use of one of the coordinate systems developed in Chapter 2. The choice of an appropriate coordinate system depends on the type of motion involved and is a vital step in the formulation of any problem. Equation 3/3, or any one of the component forms of the force- mass-acceleration equation, is usually called the equation of motion. The equation of motion gives the instantaneous value of the acceleration cor- responding to the instantaneous values of the forces which are acting. Two Types of Dynamics Problems We encounter two types of problems when applying Eq. 3/3. In the ﬁrst type, the acceleration of the particle is either speciﬁed or can be de- termined directly from known kinematic conditions. We then determine the corresponding forces which act on the particle by direct substitution into Eq. 3/3. This problem is generally quite straightforward. In the second type of problem, the forces acting on the particle are speciﬁed and we must determine the resulting motion. If the forces are constant, the acceleration is also constant and is easily found from Eq. 3/3. When the forces are functions of time, position, or velocity, Eq. 3/3 becomes a differential equation which must be integrated to determine the velocity and displacement. Problems of this second type are often more formidable, as the inte- gration may be difﬁcult to carry out, particularly when the force is a mixed function of two or more motion variables. In practice, it is fre- quently necessary to resort to approximate integration techniques, ei- ther numerical or graphical, particularly when experimental data are involved. The procedures for a mathematical integration of the accelera- tion when it is a function of the motion variables were developed in Art. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 123 Article 3/3 Equation of Motion and Solution of Problems 123 2/2, and these same procedures apply when the force is a speciﬁed func- tion of these same parameters, since force and acceleration differ only by the constant factor of the mass. Constrained and Unconstrained Motion There are two physically distinct types of motion, both described by Eq. 3/3. The ﬁrst type is unconstrained motion where the particle is free of mechanical guides and follows a path determined by its initial motion and by the forces which are applied to it from external sources. An air- plane or rocket in ﬂight and an electron moving in a charged ﬁeld are examples of unconstrained motion. The second type is constrained motion where the path of the parti- cle is partially or totally determined by restraining guides. An ice- hockey puck is partially constrained to move in the horizontal plane by the surface of the ice. A train moving along its track and a collar sliding along a ﬁxed shaft are examples of more fully constrained motion. Some of the forces acting on a particle during constrained motion may be ap- plied from outside sources, and others may be the reactions on the parti- cle from the constraining guides. All forces, both applied and reactive, which act on the particle must be accounted for in applying Eq. 3/3. The choice of an appropriate coordinate system is frequently indi- cated by the number and geometry of the constraints. Thus, if a particle is free to move in space, as is the center of mass of the airplane or rocket in free ﬂight, the particle is said to have three degrees of freedom since three independent coordinates are required to specify the position of the particle at any instant. All three of the scalar components of the equa- tion of motion would have to be integrated to obtain the space coordi- nates as a function of time. If a particle is constrained to move along a surface, as is the hockey puck or a marble sliding on the curved surface of a bowl, only two coor- dinates are needed to specify its position, and in this case it is said to have two degrees of freedom. If a particle is constrained to move along a ﬁxed linear path, as is the collar sliding along a ﬁxed shaft, its position may be speciﬁed by the coordinate measured along the shaft. In this case, the particle would have only one degree of freedom. KEY CONCEPTS Free-Body Diagram When applying any of the force-mass-acceleration equations of mo- tion, you must account correctly for all forces acting on the particle. The only forces which we may neglect are those whose magnitudes are negli- gible compared with other forces acting, such as the forces of mutual at- traction between two particles compared with their attraction to a celestial body such as the earth. The vector sum ΣF of Eq. 3/3 means the vector sum of all forces acting on the particle in question. Likewise, the corresponding scalar force summation in any one of the component di- rections means the sum of the components of all forces acting on the particle in that particular direction. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 124 124 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles The only reliable way to account accurately and consistently for every force is to isolate the particle under consideration from all con- tacting and inﬂuencing bodies and replace the bodies removed by the forces they exert on the particle isolated. The resulting free-body dia- gram is the means by which every force, known and unknown, which acts on the particle is represented and thus accounted for. Only after this vital step has been completed should you write the appropriate equation or equations of motion. The free-body diagram serves the same key purpose in dynamics as it does in statics. This purpose is simply to establish a thoroughly reli- able method for the correct evaluation of the resultant of all actual forces acting on the particle or body in question. In statics this resultant equals zero, whereas in dynamics it is equated to the product of mass and acceleration. When you use the vector form of the equation of mo- tion, remember that it represents several scalar equations and that every equation must be satisﬁed. Careful and consistent use of the free-body method is the most im- portant single lesson to be learned in the study of engineering mechan- ics. When drawing a free-body diagram, clearly indicate the coordinate axes and their positive directions. When you write the equations of mo- tion, make sure all force summations are consistent with the choice of these positive directions. As an aid to the identiﬁcation of external forces which act on the body in question, these forces are shown as heavy red vectors in the illustrations in this book. Sample Problems 3/1 through 3/5 in the next article contain ﬁve examples of free-body dia- grams. You should study these to see how the diagrams are constructed. In solving problems, you may wonder how to get started and what sequence of steps to follow in arriving at the solution. This difﬁculty may be minimized by forming the habit of ﬁrst recognizing some rela- tionship between the desired unknown quantity in the problem and other quantities, known and unknown. Then determine additional rela- tionships between these unknowns and other quantities, known and un- known. Finally, establish the dependence on the original data and develop the procedure for the analysis and computation. A few minutes spent organizing the plan of attack through recognition of the depen- dence of one quantity on another will be time well spent and will usually prevent groping for the answer with irrelevant calculations. 3/4 Rectilinear Motion We now apply the concepts discussed in Arts. 3/2 and 3/3 to prob- lems in particle motion, starting with rectilinear motion in this article and treating curvilinear motion in Art. 3/5. In both articles, we will ana- lyze the motions of bodies which can be treated as particles. This simpli- ﬁcation is possible as long as we are interested only in the motion of the mass center of the body. In this case we may treat the forces as concur- rent through the mass center. We will account for the action of noncon- current forces on the motions of bodies when we discuss the kinetics of rigid bodies in Chapter 6. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 125 Article 3/4 Rectilinear Motion 125 If we choose the x-direction, for example, as the direction of the rec- tilinear motion of a particle of mass m, the acceleration in the y- and z-directions will be zero and the scalar components of Eq. 3/3 become ΣFx (cid:2) max ΣFy (cid:2) 0 ΣFz (cid:2) 0 (3/4) For cases where we are not free to choose a coordinate direction along the motion, we would have in the general case all three compo- nent equations ΣFx (cid:2) max ΣFy (cid:2) may ΣFz (cid:2) maz (3/5) where the acceleration and resultant force are given by a (cid:2) axi (cid:5) ay j (cid:5) azk a (cid:2) (cid:3)ax 2 (cid:5) az 2 (cid:5) ay 2 ΣF (cid:2) ΣFxi (cid:5) ΣFy j (cid:5) ΣFzk (cid:2)ΣF(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3)(ΣFx)2 (cid:5) (ΣFy)2 (cid:5) (ΣFz)2 l y m a A / K T C © This view of a car-collision test suggests that very large accelerations and accompanying large forces occur throughout the system of the two cars. The crash dummies are also subjected to large forces, primarily by the shoulder-harness/seat-belt restraints. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 126 126 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles 126 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/1 A 75-kg man stands on a spring scale in an elevator. During the ﬁrst 3 sec- onds of motion from rest, the tension T in the hoisting cable is 8300 N. Find the reading R of the scale in newtons during this interval and the upward velocity v of the elevator at the end of the 3 seconds. The total mass of the elevator, man, and scale is 750 kg. Solution. The force registered by the scale and the velocity both depend on the acceleration of the elevator, which is constant during the interval for which the forces are constant.

If the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction between the log and the ramp is 0.5, determine the velocity of the block as it hits the ground at B. Solution. The motions of the log and the block A are clearly dependent. Al- though by now it should be evident that the acceleration of the log up the incline is half the downward acceleration of A, we may prove it formally. The constant total length of the cable is L (cid:2) 2sC (cid:5) sA (cid:5) constant, where the constant accounts for the cable portions wrapped around the pulleys. Differentiating twice with re- spect to time gives 0 (cid:2) or (cid:5) 2s¨C s¨A, (cid:2) 0 (cid:2) 2aC (cid:5) aA We assume here that the masses of the pulleys are negligible and that they turn with negligible friction. With these assumptions the free-body diagram of the pulley C discloses force and moment equilibrium. Thus, the tension in the cable attached to the log is twice that applied to the block. Note that the acceler- ations of the log and the center of pulley C are identical. The free-body diagram of the log shows the friction force (cid:4)k N for motion up the plane.

(cid:4) Note the serious error in assuming that T (cid:2) 250 lb, in which case, block A would not accelerate. (cid:5) Because the forces on this system re- main constant, the resulting acceler- ations also remain constant. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:38 PM Page 128 128 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/4 The design model for a new ship has a mass of 10 kg and is tested in an exper- imental towing tank to determine its resistance to motion through the water at various speeds. The test results are plotted on the accompanying graph, and the resistance R may be closely approximated by the dashed parabolic curve shown. If the model is released when it has a speed of 2 m/s, determine the time t required for it to reduce its speed to 1 m/s and the corresponding travel distance x. Solution.

In applying Newton’s second law, Eq. 3/3, we will make use of the three coordinate descriptions of acceleration in curvilinear motion which we developed in Arts. 2/4, 2/5, and 2/6. The choice of an appropriate coordinate system depends on the con- ditions of the problem and is one of the basic decisions to be made in solving curvilinear-motion problems. We now rewrite Eq. 3/3 in three ways, the choice of which depends on which coordinate system is most appropriate. Rectangular coordinates (Art. 2/4, Fig. 2/7) ΣFx (cid:2) max ΣFy (cid:2) may where ax (cid:2) x¨ and ay (cid:2) y¨ Normal and tangential coordinates (Art. 2/5, Fig. 2/10) Because of the banking in the turn of this track, the normal reaction force provides most of the normal acceler- ation of the bobsled.

After you identify the motion and choose the coordinate system, draw the free-body diagram of the body. Then obtain the appropriate force summations from this diagram in the usual way. The free-body diagram should be complete to avoid incor- rect force summations. Once you assign reference axes, you must use the expressions for both the forces and the acceleration which are consistent with that as- signment. In the ﬁrst of Eqs. 3/7, for example, the positive sense of the n-axis is toward the center of curvature, and so the positive sense of our force summation ΣFn must also be toward the center of curvature to agree with the positive sense of the acceleration an (cid:2) v2/(cid:8). At the highest point of the swing, this child experiences tangential acceleration. An instant later, when she has acquired velocity, she will experience normal acceleration as well. s m o C w e N / A P E / n i i r l a z a B o n A r y m a A / l l l i a W d v a D © c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 139 Article 3/5 Curvilinear Motion 139 SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/6 Determine the maximum speed v which the sliding block may have as it passes point A without losing contact with the surface.

Determine the expression for the normal contact force N between the guide and each object in terms of (cid:5) and specify the correct angular velocity (cid:2) of the conveyor pulley of radius r to prevent any slid- ing on the belt as the objects transfer to the conveyor. Solution. The free-body diagram of the object is shown together with the co- ordinate directions n and t.

The radius of curvature (cid:8) of the road at A is 400 m and at C is 80 m. Determine the total horizontal force exerted by the road on the tires at positions A, B, and C.

The car will be treated as a particle so that the effect of all forces ex- erted by the road on the tires will be treated as a single force. Since the motion is described along the direction of the road, normal and tangential coordinates will be used to specify the acceleration of the car.

Helpful Hint (cid:2) Note that, for observations made within an inertial frame of reference, there is no such quantity as “centrifugal force” act- ing in the minus n-direction. Note also that neither the spacecraft nor its occupants are “weightless,” because the weight in each case is given by Newton’s law of gravitation. For this altitude, the weights are only about 10 percent less than the earth-surface values. Finally, the term “zero-g” is also misleading. It is only when we make our observations with respect to a coordinate system which has an acceleration equal to the gravitational acceleration (such as in an orbiting spacecraft) that we appear to be in a “zero-g” environment. The quantity which does go to zero aboard orbiting spacecraft is the fa- miliar normal force associated with, for example, an object in contact with a horizontal surface within the spacecraft.

When we needed to determine the change in velocity or the corresponding displacement of the particle, we integrated the computed acceleration by using the appropriate kinematic equations. There are two general classes of problems in which the cumulative effects of unbalanced forces acting on a particle are of interest to us. These cases involve (1) integration of the forces with respect to the dis- placement of the particle and (2) integration of the forces with respect to the time they are applied. We may incorporate the results of these inte- grations directly into the governing equations of motion so that it be- comes unnecessary to solve directly for the acceleration. Integration with respect to displacement leads to the equations of work and energy, which are the subject of this article. Integration with respect to time leads to the equations of impulse and momentum, discussed in Section C. Deﬁnition of Work We now develop the quantitative meaning of the term “work.”* Fig- ure 3/2a shows a force F acting on a particle at A which moves along the path shown. The position vector r measured from some convenient ori- gin O locates the particle as it passes point A, and dr is the differential displacement associated with an inﬁnitesimal movement from A to A(cid:2). The work done by the force F during the displacement dr is deﬁned as dU (cid:2) F (cid:2) dr The magnitude of this dot product is dU (cid:2) F ds cos (cid:9), where (cid:9) is the angle between F and dr and where ds is the magnitude of dr. This ex- pression may be interpreted as the displacement multiplied by the force component Ft (cid:2) F cos (cid:9) in the direction of the displacement, as repre- sented by the dashed lines in Fig. 3/2b. Alternatively, the work dU may be interpreted as the force multiplied by the displacement component ds cos (cid:9) in the direction of the force, as represented by the full lines in Fig. 3/2b. With this deﬁnition of work, it should be noted that the component Fn (cid:2) F sin (cid:9) normal to the displacement does no work. Thus, the work dU may be written as dU (cid:2) Ft ds Work is positive if the working component Ft is in the direction of the displacement and negative if it is in the opposite direction. Forces which *The concept of work was also developed in the study of virtual work in Chapter 7 of Vol. 1 Statics. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 155 Article 3/6 Work and Kinetic Energy 155 do work are termed active forces. Constraint forces which do no work are termed reactive forces. Units of Work N (cid:2) m. The SI units of work are those of force (N) times displacement (m) or This unit is given the special name joule (J), which is deﬁned as the work done by a force of 1 N acting through a distance of 1 m in the direction of the force. Consistent use of the joule for work (and energy) rather than the units will avoid possible ambiguity with the units of moment of a force or torque, which are also written N (cid:2) m. N (cid:2) m In the U.S. customary system, work has the units of ft-lb. Dimen- sionally, work and moment are the same. In order to distinguish be- tween the two quantities, it is recommended that work be expressed as foot pounds (ft-lb) and moment as pound feet (lb-ft). It should be noted that work is a scalar as given by the dot product and involves the prod- uct of a force and a distance, both measured along the same line. Mo- ment, on the other hand, is a vector as given by the cross product and involves the product of force and distance measured at right angles to the force. Calculation of Work During a ﬁnite movement of the point of application of a force, the force does an amount of work equal to U (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 1 (Fx dx (cid:5) Fy dy (cid:5) Fz dz) or U (cid:2) (cid:4) s2 s1 Ft ds In order to carry out this integration, it is necessary to know the rela- tions between the force components and their respective coordinates or the relation between Ft and s. If the functional relationship is not known as a mathematical expression which can be integrated but is speciﬁed in the form of approximate or experimental data, then we can compute the work by carrying out a numerical or graphical integration as represented by the area under the curve of Ft versus s, as shown in Fig. 3/3. Ft Examples of Work When work must be calculated, we may always begin with the deﬁn- ition of work, U (cid:2) insert appropriate vector expressions for the (cid:4) F (cid:2) dr, force F and the differential displacement vector dr, and carry out the re- quired integration. With some experience, simple work calculations, such as those associated with constant forces, may be performed by in- spection. We now formally compute the work associated with three fre- quently occurring forces: constant forces, spring forces, and weights. dU = Ft ds s1 s2 s Figure 3/3 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 156 156 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles x y 1 P dr α L Figure 3/4 2 (1) Work Associated with a Constant External Force. Consider the constant force P applied to the body as it moves from position 1 to position 2, Fig. 3/4. With the force P and the differential displacement dr written as vectors, the work done on the body by the force is U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 (cid:2) (cid:4) x2 1 x1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 [(P cos (cid:9))i (cid:5) (P sin (cid:9))j] (cid:2) dx i 1 P cos (cid:9) dx (cid:2) P cos (cid:9)(x2 (cid:3) x1) (cid:2) PL cos (cid:9) (3/9) As previously discussed, this work expression may be interpreted as the force component P cos (cid:9) times the distance L traveled. Should (cid:9) be be- tween 90(cid:3) and 270(cid:3), the work would be negative. The force component P sin (cid:9) normal to the displacement does no work. (2) Work Associated with a Spring Force. We consider here the common linear spring of stiffness k where the force required to stretch or compress the spring is proportional to the deformation x, as shown in Fig. 3/5a. We wish to determine the work done on the body by the spring force as the body undergoes an arbitrary displacement from an initial position x1 to a ﬁnal position x2. The force exerted by the spring on the body is F (cid:2) (cid:3)kxi, as shown in Fig. 3/5b. From the deﬁnition of work, we have U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 ((cid:3)kxi) (cid:2) dx i (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4) x2 1 x1 kx dx (cid:2) 1 2 k(x1 2 (cid:3) x2 2) (3/10) If the initial position is the position of zero spring deformation so that x1 (cid:2) 0, then the work is negative for any ﬁnal position x2 (cid:3) 0. This is veriﬁed by recognizing that if the body begins at the undeformed spring position and then moves to the right, the spring force is to the left; if the body begins at x1 (cid:2) 0 and moves to the left, the spring force is to the right. On the other hand, if we move from an arbitrary initial po- sition x1 (cid:3) 0 to the undeformed ﬁnal position x2 (cid:2) 0, we see that the work is positive. In any movement toward the undeformed spring posi- tion, the spring force and the displacement are in the same direction. In the general case, of course, neither x1 nor x2 is zero. The magni- tude of the work is equal to the shaded trapezoidal area of Fig. 3/5a. In calculating the work done on a body by a spring force, care must be c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 157 Article 3/6 Work and Kinetic Energy 157 Force F required to stretch or compress spring F = kx x 1 x 2 x dr (a) Undeformed position kx x (b) Figure 3/5 taken to ensure that the units of k and x are consistent. If x is in meters (or feet), k must be in N/m (or lb/ft). In addition, be sure to recognize that the variable x represents a deformation from the unstretched spring length and not the total length of the spring. The expression F (cid:2) kx is actually a static relationship which is true only when elements of the spring have no acceleration. The dynamic be- havior of a spring when its mass is accounted for is a fairly complex problem which will not be treated here. We shall assume that the mass of the spring is small compared with the masses of other accelerating parts of the system, in which case the linear static relationship will not involve appreciable error. (3) Work Associated with Weight. Case (a) g (cid:2) constant. If the al- titude variation is sufﬁciently small so that the acceleration of gravity g may be considered constant, the work done by the weight mg of the body shown in Fig. 3/6a as the body is displaced from an arbitrary alti- tude y1 to a ﬁnal altitude y2 is U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 ((cid:3)mgj) (cid:2) (dxi (cid:5) dyj) (cid:2) (cid:3)mg (cid:4) y2 y1 dy (cid:2) (cid:3)mg( y2 (cid:3) y1) (3/11) c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 158 158 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles y2 m 2 dr y 1 mg y1 x R Earth me er 2 m dr r2 (a) Gmem —–— r2 1 r1 r (b) Figure 3/6 We see that horizontal movement does not contribute to this work. We also note that if the body rises (perhaps due to other forces not shown), then ( y2 (cid:3) y1) (cid:4) 0 and this work is negative. If the body falls, ( y2 (cid:3) y1) (cid:5) 0 and the work is positive. Case (b) g (cid:3) constant. If large changes in altitude occur, then the weight (gravitational force) is no longer constant. We must therefore use the gravitational law (Eq. 1/2) and express the weight as a variable force of magnitude F (cid:2) Gmem 2 r , as indicated in Fig. 3/6b. Using the radial coordinate shown in the ﬁgure allows the work to be expressed as U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 (cid:2) Gmem(cid:6) 1 r2 (cid:3) (cid:3)Gmem er r2 (cid:7) (cid:2) mgR2(cid:6) 1 r2 1 1 r1 (cid:2) dr er (cid:2) (cid:3)Gmem (cid:4) r2 (cid:7) (cid:3) r1 1 r1 dr r2 (3/12) where the equivalence Gme (cid:2) gR2 was established in Art. 1/5, with g representing the acceleration of gravity at the earth’s surface and R rep- resenting the radius of the earth. The student should verify that if a body rises to a higher altitude (r2 (cid:4) r1), this work is negative, as it was in case (a). If the body falls to a lower altitude (r2 (cid:5) r1), the work is posi- tive. Be sure to realize that r represents a radial distance from the cen- ter of the earth and not an altitude h (cid:2) r (cid:3) R above the surface of the earth. As in case (a), had we considered a transverse displacement in ad- dition to the radial displacement shown in Fig. 3/6b, we would have con- cluded that the transverse displacement, because it is perpendicular to the weight, does not contribute to the work. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 159 Article 3/6 Work and Kinetic Energy 159 Work and Curvilinear Motion We now consider the work done on a particle of mass m, Fig. 3/7, moving along a curved path under the action of the force F, which stands for the resultant ΣF of all forces acting on the particle. The posi- tion of m is speciﬁed by the position vector r, and its displacement along its path during the time dt is represented by the change dr in its posi- tion vector. The work done by F during a ﬁnite movement of the parti- cle from point 1 to point 2 is U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) s2 s1 Ft ds z t 2 s2 O Fn dr α m F = Σ F r n Ft 1 y Path s1 where the limits specify the initial and ﬁnal end points of the motion. When we substitute Newton’s second law F (cid:2) ma, the expression for the work of all forces becomes x Figure 3/7 U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 ma (cid:2) dr a (cid:2) dr (cid:2) at ds, where at is the tangential component of the accelera- But tion of m. In terms of the velocity v of the particle, Eq. 2/3 gives at ds (cid:2) v dv. Thus, the expression for the work of F becomes U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 1 F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4) v2 v1 mv dv (cid:2) 1 2 m(v2 2 (cid:3) v1 2) (3/13) where the integration is carried out between points 1 and 2 along the curve, at which points the velocities have the magnitudes v1 and v2, respectively. Principle of Work and Kinetic Energy The kinetic energy T of the particle is deﬁned as T (cid:2) 1 2 mv2 (3/14) and is the total work which must be done on the particle to bring it from a state of rest to a velocity v. Kinetic energy T is a scalar quantity with the units of or joules (J) in SI units and ft-lb in U.S. customary units. Kinetic energy is always positive, regardless of the direction of the velocity. N (cid:2) m Equation 3/13 may be restated as U1-2 (cid:2) T2 (cid:3) T1 (cid:2) (cid:6)T (3/15) which is the work-energy equation for a particle. The equation states that the total work done by all forces acting on a particle as it moves from point 1 to point 2 equals the corresponding change in kinetic en- ergy of the particle. Although T is always positive, the change (cid:6)T may c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 160 160 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles be positive, negative, or zero. When written in this concise form, Eq. 3/15 tells us that the work always results in a change of kinetic energy. Alternatively, the work-energy relation may be expressed as the ini- tial kinetic energy T1 plus the work done U1-2 equals the ﬁnal kinetic en- ergy T2, or T1 (cid:5) U1-2 (cid:2) T2 (3/15a) When written in this form, the terms correspond to the natural se- quence of events. Clearly, the two forms 3/15 and 3/15a are equivalent. Advantages of the Work-Energy Method We now see from Eq. 3/15 that a major advantage of the method of work and energy is that it avoids the necessity of computing the acceler- ation and leads directly to the velocity changes as functions of the forces which do work. Further, the work-energy equation involves only those forces which do work and thus give rise to changes in the magnitude of the velocities. We consider now a system of two particles joined together by a con- nection which is frictionless and incapable of any deformation. The forces in the connection are equal and opposite, and their points of ap- plication necessarily have identical displacement components in the di- rection of the forces. Therefore, the net work done by these internal forces is zero during any movement of the system. Thus, Eq. 3/15 is ap- plicable to the entire system, where U1-2 is the total or net work done on the system by forces external to it and (cid:6)T is the change, T2 (cid:3) T1, in the total kinetic energy of the system. The total kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of both elements of the system. We thus see that another advantage of the work-energy method is that it enables us to analyze a system of particles joined in the manner described without dismembering the system. Application of the work-energy method requires isolation of the par- ticle or system under consideration. For a single particle you should draw a free-body diagram showing all externally applied forces. For a system of particles rigidly connected without springs, draw an active- force diagram showing only those external forces which do work (active forces) on the entire system.* Power The capacity of a machine is measured by the time rate at which it can do work or deliver energy. The total work or energy output is not a measure of this capacity since a motor, no matter how small, can deliver a large amount of energy if given sufﬁcient time. On the other hand, a large and powerful machine is required to deliver a large amount of en- ergy in a short period of time. Thus, the capacity of a machine is rated by its power, which is deﬁned as the time rate of doing work. *The active-force diagram was introduced in the method of virtual work in statics. See Chapter 7 of Vol. 1 Statics. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 161 Article 3/6 Work and Kinetic Energy 161 Accordingly, the power P developed by a force F which does an F (cid:2) dr/dt. Because dr/dt is the velocity v amount of work U is P (cid:2) dU/dt (cid:2) of the point of application of the force, we have P (cid:2) F (cid:2) v (3/16) (cid:2) J/s. Power is clearly a scalar quantity, and in SI it has the units of The special unit for power is the watt (W), which equals one joule per sec- ond (J/s). In U.S. customary units, the unit for mechanical power is the horsepower (hp). These units and their numerical equivalences are N (cid:2) m/s 1 W (cid:2) 1 J/s 1 hp (cid:2) 550 ft-lb/sec (cid:2) 33,000 ft-lb/min 1 hp (cid:2) 746 W (cid:2) 0.746 kW Efﬁciency The ratio of the work done by a machine to the work done on the machine during the same time interval is called the mechanical efﬁ- ciency em of the machine. This deﬁnition assumes that the machine op- erates uniformly so that there is no accumulation or depletion of energy within it. Efﬁciency is always less than unity since every device operates with some loss of energy and since energy cannot be created within the machine. In mechanical devices which involve moving parts, there will always be some loss of energy due to the negative work of kinetic fric- tion forces. This work is converted to heat energy which, in turn, is dis- sipated to the surroundings. The mechanical efﬁciency at any instant of time may be expressed in terms of mechanical power P by em (cid:2) Poutput Pinput (3/17) In addition to energy loss by mechanical friction, there may also be electrical and thermal energy loss, in which case, the electrical efﬁciency ee and thermal efﬁciency et are also involved. The overall efﬁciency e in such instances is e (cid:2) emeeet y r e k a B a d e M i The power which must be produced by a bike rider depends on the bicy- cle speed and the propulsive force which is exerted by the supporting surface on the rear wheel. The dri- ving force depends on the slope being negotiated. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 162 162 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/11 Calculate the velocity v of the 50-kg crate when it reaches the bottom of the chute at B if it is given an initial velocity of 4 m/s down the chute at A. The coef- ﬁcient of kinetic friction is 0.30. Solution. The free-body diagram of the crate is drawn and includes the nor- mal force R and the kinetic friction force F calculated in the usual manner. The work done by the weight is positive, whereas that done by the friction force is negative. The total work done on the crate during the motion is (cid:2) [U (cid:2) Fs] U1-2 (cid:2) 50(9.81)(10 sin 15(cid:3)) (cid:3) 142.1(10) (cid:2) (cid:3)151.9 J 1 0 m 5 0 k g A B 15° 50(9.81) N The work-energy equation gives [T1 (cid:5) U1-2 (cid:2) T2] 2 μ kR = 142.1 N R = 474 N 1 2 mv1 2 (cid:5) U1-2 (cid:2) 1 2 (50)(4)2 (cid:3) 151.9 (cid:2) 1 1 2 mv2 2 2 (50)v2 v2 (cid:2) 3.15 m/s Ans. Since the net work done is negative, we obtain a decrease in the kinetic energy. SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/12 The ﬂatbed truck, which carries an 80-kg crate, starts from rest and attains a speed of 72 km/h in a distance of 75 m on a level road with constant accelera- tion. Calculate the work done by the friction force acting on the crate during this interval if the static and kinetic coefﬁcients of friction between the crate and the truck bed are (a) 0.30 and 0.28, respectively, or (b) 0.25 and 0.20, respectively. Solution. If the crate does not slip on the bed, its acceleration will be that of the truck, which is [v2 (cid:2) 2as] a (cid:2) v2 2s (cid:2) (72/3.6)2 2(75) (cid:2) 2.67 m/s2 Case (a). This acceleration requires a friction force on the block of [F (cid:2) ma] F (cid:2) 80(2.67) (cid:2) 213 N which is less than the maximum possible value of (cid:4)sN (cid:2) 0.30(80)(9.81) = 235 N. Therefore, the crate does not slip and the work done by the actual static friction force of 213 N is (cid:2) [U (cid:2) Fs] U1-2 (cid:2) 213(75) (cid:2) 16 000 J or 16 kJ Ans. Case (b). For (cid:4)s (cid:2) 0.25, the maximum possible friction force is 0.25(80)(9.81) (cid:2) 196.2 N, which is slightly less than the value of 213 N required for no slipping. Therefore, we conclude that the crate slips, and the friction force is governed by the kinetic coefﬁcient and is F (cid:2) 0.20(80)(9.81) = 157.0 N. The acceleration becomes [F (cid:2) ma] a (cid:2) F/m (cid:2) 157.0/80 (cid:2) 1.962 m/s2 The distances traveled by the crate and the truck are in proportion to their ac- celerations. Thus, the crate has a displacement of (1.962/2.67)75 = 55.2 m, and the work done by kinetic friction is (cid:3) [U (cid:2) Fs] U1-2 (cid:2) 157.0(55.2) (cid:2) 8660 J or 8.66 kJ Ans. Helpful Hint (cid:2) The work due to the weight depends only on the vertical distance traveled. 80(9.81) N F 80(9.81) N a Helpful Hints (cid:2) We note that static friction forces do no work when the contacting sur- faces are both at rest. When they are in motion, however, as in this prob- lem, the static friction force acting on the crate does positive work and that acting on the truck bed does negative work. (cid:3) This problem shows that a kinetic friction force can do positive work when the surface which supports the object and generates the friction force is in motion. If the supporting surface is at rest, then the kinetic friction force acting on the moving part always does negative work. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 163 Article 3/6 Work and Kinetic Energy 163 SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/13 The 50-kg block at A is mounted on rollers so that it moves along the ﬁxed horizontal rail with negligible friction under the action of the constant 300-N force in the cable. The block is released from rest at A, with the spring to which it is attached extended an initial amount x1 (cid:2) 0.233 m. The spring has a stiffness k (cid:2) 80 N/m. Calculate the velocity v of the block as it reaches position B. Solution. It will be assumed initially that the stiffness of the spring is small enough to allow the block to reach position B. The active-force diagram for the system composed of both block and cable is shown for a general position. The spring force 80x and the 300-N tension are the only forces external to this sys- tem which do work on the system. The force exerted on the block by the rail, the weight of the block, and the reaction of the small pulley on the cable do no work on the system and are not included on the active-force diagram. As the block moves from x1 (cid:2) 0.233 m to x2 (cid:2) 0.233 (cid:5) 1.2 (cid:2) 1.433 m, the work done by the spring force acting on the block is x 80x A x1 1.2 m 300 N C 0.9 m B 300 N System (cid:2) [U1-2 (cid:2) 1 2 k(x1 2 (cid:3) x2 2)] U1-2 (cid:2) 1 2 80[0.2332 (cid:3) (0.233 (cid:5) 1.2)2] (cid:2) (cid:3)80.0 J The work done on the system by the constant 300-N force in the cable is the force times the net horizontal movement of the cable over pulley C, which is (cid:3) 0.9 (cid:2) 0.6 m. Thus, the work done is 300(0.6) (cid:2) 180 J. We now (cid:3)(1.2)2 (cid:5) (0.9)2 apply the work-energy equation to the system and get [T1 (cid:5) U1-2 (cid:2) T2] 0 (cid:3) 80.0 (cid:5) 180 (cid:2) 1 2 (50)v2 v (cid:2) 2.00 m/s Ans. We take special note of the advantage to our choice of system. If the block alone had constituted the system, the horizontal component of the 300-N cable tension on the block would have to be integrated over the 1.2-m displacement. This step would require considerably more effort than was needed in the solu- tion as presented. If there had been appreciable friction between the block and its guiding rail, we would have found it necessary to isolate the block alone in order to compute the variable normal force and, hence, the variable friction force. Integration of the friction force over the displacement would then be re- quired to evaluate the negative work which it would do. Helpful Hint (cid:2) Recall that this general formula is valid for any initial and ﬁnal spring deﬂections x1 and x2, positive (spring in tension) or negative (spring in compression). In deriving the spring- work formula, we assumed the spring to be linear, which is the case here. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 164 164 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/14 The power winch A hoists the 800-lb log up the 30(cid:3) incline at a constant speed of 4 ft/sec.

If the power is suddenly increased to 8 hp, what is the corresponding instantaneous acceleration a of the log? Solution. From the free-body diagram of the log, we get N (cid:2) 800 cos 30(cid:3) (cid:2) 693 lb, and the kinetic friction force becomes 693(cid:4)k.

SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/15 A satellite of mass m is put into an elliptical orbit around the earth. At point A, its distance from the earth is h1 (cid:2) 500 km and it has a velocity v1 (cid:2) 30 000 km/h. Determine the velocity v2 of the satellite as it reaches point B, a distance h2 (cid:2) 1200 km from the earth. Solution. The satellite is moving outside of the earth’s atmosphere so that the only force acting on it is the gravitational attraction of the earth. For the large change in altitude of this problem, we cannot assume that the acceleration due to gravity is constant. Rather, we must use the work expression, derived in this article, which accounts for variation in the gravitational acceleration with alti- tude.

We did this to evaluate U in the work- energy equation. In the present article we will introduce the concept of potential energy to treat the work done by gravity forces and by spring forces. This concept will simplify the analysis of many problems. Gravitational Potential Energy We consider ﬁrst the motion of a particle of mass m in close proxim- ity to the surface of the earth, where the gravitational attraction (weight) mg is essentially constant, Fig. 3/8a. The gravitational poten- tial energy Vg of the particle is deﬁned as the work mgh done against the gravitational ﬁeld to elevate the particle a distance h above some arbi- trary reference plane (called a datum), where Vg is taken to be zero. Thus, we write the potential energy as Vg (cid:2) mgh (3/18) This work is called potential energy because it may be converted into energy if the particle is allowed to do work on a supporting body while it returns to its lower original datum plane. In going from one level at h (cid:2) h1 to a higher level at h (cid:2) h2, the change in potential energy becomes (cid:6)Vg (cid:2) mg(h2 (cid:3) h1) (cid:2) mg(cid:6)h The corresponding work done by the gravitational force on the particle is (cid:3)mg(cid:6)h. Thus, the work done by the gravitational force is the nega- tive of the change in potential energy. When large changes in altitude in the ﬁeld of the earth are encoun- tered, Fig. 3/8b, the gravitational force Gmme/r2 (cid:2) mgR2/r2 is no longer constant. The work done against this force to change the radial position of the particle from r1 to r2 is the change (Vg)2 (cid:3) (Vg)1 in gravitational potential energy, which is Article 3/7 Potential Energy 175 Vg = mgh h mg Vg = 0 (a) m Vg = – mgR2 —–— r r R Earth me mgR2 —–— r2 (cid:4) r2 r1 mgR2 dr r2 (cid:2) mgR2 (cid:6) 1 r1 (cid:3) 1 r2 (cid:7) (cid:2) (Vg)2 (cid:3) (Vg)1 (b) Figure 3/8 It is customary to take (Vg)2 (cid:2) 0 when r2 (cid:2) (cid:2), so that with this datum we have Vg (cid:2) (cid:3) mgR2 r (3/19) In going from r1 to r2, the corresponding change in potential energy is (cid:6)Vg (cid:2) mgR2 (cid:6) 1 r1 1 r2 (cid:3) (cid:7) c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 176 176 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles which, again, is the negative of the work done by the gravitational force. We note that the potential energy of a given particle depends only on its position, h or r, and not on the particular path it followed in reaching that position. Elastic Potential Energy The second example of potential energy occurs in the deformation of an elastic body, such as a spring. The work which is done on the spring to deform it is stored in the spring and is called its elastic potential energy Ve. This energy is recoverable in the form of work done by the spring on the body attached to its movable end during the release of the deformation of the spring. For the one-dimensional linear spring of stiffness k, which we discussed in Art. 3/6 and illustrated in Fig. 3/5, the force supported by the spring at any deformation x, tensile or compressive, from its undeformed position is F (cid:2) kx. Thus, we deﬁne the elastic potential energy of the spring as the work done on it to deform it an amount x, and we have Ve (cid:2) (cid:4) x 0 kx dx (cid:2) 1 2 kx2 (3/20) If the deformation, either tensile or compressive, of a spring in- creases from x1 to x2 during the motion, then the change in potential en- ergy of the spring is its ﬁnal value minus its initial value or (cid:6)Ve (cid:2) 1 2 k(x2 2 (cid:3) x1 2) which is positive. Conversely, if the deformation of a spring decreases during the motion interval, then the change in potential energy of the spring becomes negative. The magnitude of these changes is repre- sented by the shaded trapezoidal area in the F-x diagram of Fig. 3/5a. Because the force exerted on the spring by the moving body is equal and opposite to the force F exerted by the spring on the body, it follows that the work done on the spring is the negative of the work done on the body. Therefore, we may replace the work U done by the spring on the body by (cid:3)(cid:6)Ve, the negative of the potential energy change for the spring, provided the spring is now included within the system. Work-Energy Equation With the elastic member included in the system, we now modify the U(cid:2) work-energy equation to account for the potential-energy terms. If 1-2 stands for the work of all external forces other than gravitational forces (cid:5) ((cid:3)(cid:6)Vg) (cid:5) ((cid:3)(cid:6)Ve) (cid:2) and spring forces, we may write Eq. 3/15 as (cid:6)T or U(cid:2) 1-2 U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:2) (cid:6)T (cid:5)(cid:6)V (3/21) where (cid:6)V is the change in total potential energy, gravitational plus elastic. This alternative form of the work-energy equation is often far more convenient to use than Eq. 3/15, since the work of both gravity and spring forces is accounted for by focusing attention on the end-point positions of c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 177 Article 3/7 Potential Energy 177 the particle and on the end-point lengths of the elastic spring. The path followed between these end-point positions is of no consequence in the evaluation of (cid:6)Vg and (cid:6)Ve. Note that Eq. 3/21 may be rewritten in the equivalent form T1 (cid:5) V1 (cid:5) U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:2) T2 (cid:5) V2 (3/21a) To help clarify the difference between the use of Eqs. 3/15 and 3/21, Fig. 3/9 shows schematically a particle of mass m constrained to move along a ﬁxed path under the action of forces F1 and F2, the gravitational force W (cid:2) mg, the spring force F, and the normal reaction N. In Fig. 3/9b, the particle is isolated with its free-body diagram. The work done by each of the forces F1, F2, W, and the spring force F (cid:2) kx is evaluated, say, from A to B, and equated to the change (cid:6)T in kinetic energy using Eq. 3/15. The constraint reaction N, if normal to the path, will do no work. The alternative approach is shown in Fig. 3/9c, where the spring is included as a part of the isolated system. The work done during the interval by F1 and F2 is the -term of Eq. 3/21 with the changes in elastic and gravitational potential energies included on the energy side of the equation. U(cid:2) 1-2 We note with the first approach that the work done by F (cid:2) kx could require a somewhat awkward integration to account for the changes in magnitude and direction of F as the particle moves from A A F1 B F2 (a) N F1 F1 System F2 F = kx W = mg U1-2 = Δ T (b) U′ 1-2 = Δ T + Δ V (c) Figure 3/9 Vg = mgh F2 h Vg = 0 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 178 178 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles y 2 F dr 1 r z x Figure 3/10 to B. With the second approach, however, only the initial and final lengths of the spring are required to evaluate (cid:6)Ve. This greatly simpli- fies the calculation. For problems where the only forces are gravitational, elastic, and nonworking constraint forces, the U(cid:2)-term of Eq. 3/21a is zero, and the energy equation becomes T1 (cid:5) V1 (cid:2) T2 (cid:5) V2 or E1 (cid:2) E2 (3/22) where E (cid:2) T (cid:5) V is the total mechanical energy of the particle and its attached spring. When E is constant, we see that transfers of energy be- tween kinetic and potential may take place as long as the total mechani- cal energy T (cid:5) V does not change. Equation 3/22 expresses the law of conservation of dynamical energy. Conservative Force Fields* We have observed that the work done against a gravitational or an elastic force depends only on the net change of position and not on the particular path followed in reaching the new position. Forces with this characteristic are associated with conservative force ﬁelds, which possess an important mathematical property. Consider a force ﬁeld where the force F is a function of the coordi- nates, Fig. 3/10. The work done by F during a displacement dr of its point of application is dU (cid:2) . The total work done along its path from 1 to 2 is F (cid:2) dr U (cid:2) (cid:4)F (cid:2) dr (cid:2) (cid:4)(Fx dx (cid:5) Fy dy (cid:5) Fz dz) The integral (cid:4)F (cid:2) dr is a line integral which depends, in general, on the particular path followed between any two points 1 and 2 in space.

We found that the velocity changes could be expressed directly in terms of the work done or in terms of the overall changes in energy. In the next two arti- cles, we will integrate the equation of motion with respect to time rather than displacement. This approach leads to the equations of impulse and momentum. These equations greatly facilitate the solution of many prob- lems in which the applied forces act during extremely short periods of time (as in impact problems) or over speciﬁed intervals of time. 3/9 Linear Impulse and Linear Momentum Consider again the general curvilinear motion in space of a particle of mass m, Fig. 3/11, where the particle is located by its position vector r measured from a ﬁxed origin O. The velocity of the particle is v (cid:2) and is tangent to its path (shown as a dashed line). The resultant ΣF of all v˙ . We may now write forces on m is in the direction of its acceleration the basic equation of motion for the particle, Eq. 3/3, as r˙ ΣF (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:2) d dt (mv) or ΣF (cid:2) G˙ (3/25) where the product of the mass and velocity is deﬁned as the linear mo- mentum G (cid:2) mv of the particle. Equation 3/25 states that the resultant of all forces acting on a particle equals its time rate of change of linear momentum. In SI the units of linear momentum mv are seen to be kg (cid:2) m/s . In U.S. customary units, the units of linear momentum mv are [lb/(ft/sec2)][ft/sec] (cid:2) lb-sec. , which also equals N (cid:2) s Because Eq. 3/25 is a vector equation, we recognize that, in addition to the equality of the magnitudes of ΣF and , the direction of the resultant force coincides with the direction of the rate of change in linear momen- tum, which is the direction of the rate of change in velocity. Equation 3/25 is one of the most useful and important relationships in dynamics, and it is valid as long as the mass m of the particle is not changing with time. The case where m changes with time is discussed in Art. 4/7 of Chapter 4. G˙ We now write the three scalar components of Eq. 3/25 as ΣFx (cid:2) G˙ x ΣFy (cid:2) G˙ y ΣFz (cid:2) G˙ z (3/26) These equations may be applied independently of one another. The Linear Impulse-Momentum Principle All that we have done so far in this article is to rewrite Newton’s second law in an alternative form in terms of momentum. But we are now able to describe the effect of the resultant force ΣF on the linear t2 v2 z G = mv · v = r · v m · G r2 r ΣF y v1 t1 O r1 Path x Figure 3/11 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 192 192 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles momentum of the particle over a ﬁnite period of time simply by inte- grating Eq. 3/25 with respect to the time t. Multiplying the equation by dt gives ΣF dt (cid:2) dG, which we integrate from time t1 to time t2 to obtain (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣF dt (cid:2) G2 (cid:3) G1 (cid:2) (cid:6)G (3/27) Here the linear momentum at time t2 is G2 (cid:2) mv2 and the linear momen- tum at time t1 is G1 (cid:2) mv1. The product of force and time is deﬁned as the linear impulse of the force, and Eq. 3/27 states that the total linear impulse on m equals the corresponding change in linear momentum of m. Alternatively, we may write Eq. 3/27 as G1 (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣF dt (cid:2) G2 (3/27a) which says that the initial linear momentum of the body plus the linear impulse applied to it equals its ﬁnal linear momentum. The impulse integral is a vector which, in general, may involve changes in both magnitude and direction during the time interval. Under these conditions, it will be necessary to express ΣF and G in com- ponent form and then combine the integrated components. The compo- nents of Eq. 3/27a are the scalar equations t1 m(v1)x (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 m(v1)y (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 m(v1)z (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 t1 t1 ΣFx dt (cid:2) m(v2)x ΣFz dt (cid:2) m(v2)z ΣFy dt (cid:2) m(v2)y (3/27b) These three scalar impulse-momentum equations are completely independent. Whereas Eq. 3/27 clearly stresses that the external linear impulse causes a change in the linear momentum, the order of the terms in Eqs. 3/27a and 3/27b corresponds to the natural sequence of events. While the form of Eq. 3/27 may be best for the experienced dynamicist, the form of Eqs. 3/27a and 3/27b is very effective for the beginner. We now introduce the concept of the impulse-momentum diagram. Once the body to be analyzed has been clearly identiﬁed and isolated, we construct three drawings of the body as shown in Fig. 3/12. In the ﬁrst drawing, we show the initial momentum mv1, or components thereof. In G2 = mv2 G1 = mv1 + t2 t1 ΣF dt = Figure 3/12 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 193 Article 3/9 Linear Impulse and Linear Momentum 193 y t t e G / e v i t r a e C e f i L & e m i I T / s e g a m y t t e G / I L M N O J G I . c n I , s e g a m I The impact force exerted by the rac- quet on this tennis ball will usually be much larger than the weight of the tennis ball. Force, F F2 F1 t1 t2 Time, t Figure 3/13 the second or middle drawing, we show all the external linear impulses (or components thereof). In the ﬁnal drawing, we show the ﬁnal linear momentum mv2 (or its components). The writing of the impulse-momen- tum equations 3/27b then follows directly from these drawings, with a clear one-to-one correspondence between diagrams and equation terms. We note that the center diagram is very much like a free-body dia- gram, except that the impulses of the forces appear rather than the forces themselves. As with the free-body diagram, it is necessary to in- clude the effects of all forces acting on the body, except those forces whose magnitudes are negligible. In some cases, certain forces are very large and of short duration. Such forces are called impulsive forces. An example is a force of sharp impact. We frequently assume that impulsive forces are constant over their time of duration, so that they can be brought outside the linear-impulse integral. In addition, we frequently assume that nonimpulsive forces can be ne- glected in comparison with impulsive forces. An example of a nonimpulsive force is the weight of a baseball during its collision with a bat—the weight of the ball (about 5 oz) is small compared with the force (which could be several hundred pounds in magnitude) exerted on the ball by the bat. There are cases where a force acting on a particle varies with the time in a manner determined by experimental measurements or by other approximate means. In this case a graphical or numerical integra- tion must be performed. If, for example, a force F acting on a particle in a given direction varies with the time t as indicated in Fig. 3/13, then F dt, of this force from t1 to t2 is the shaded area under (cid:4) t2 t1 the impulse, the curve. Conservation of Linear Momentum If the resultant force on a particle is zero during an interval of time, we see that Eq. 3/25 requires that its linear momentum G remain con- stant. In this case, the linear momentum of the particle is said to be con- served. Linear momentum may be conserved in one coordinate direction, such as x, but not necessarily in the y- or z-direction. A careful examina- tion of the impulse-momentum diagram of the particle will disclose whether the total linear impulse on the particle in a particular direction is zero. If it is, the corresponding linear momentum is unchanged (con- served) in that direction. Consider now the motion of two particles a and b which interact during an interval of time. If the interactive forces F and (cid:3)F between them are the only unbalanced forces acting on the particles during the interval, it follows that the linear impulse on particle a is the negative of the linear impulse on particle b. Therefore, from Eq. 3/27, the change in linear momentum (cid:6)Ga of particle a is the negative of the change (cid:6)Gb in linear momentum of particle b. So we have (cid:6)Ga (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:6)Gb or (cid:6)(Ga (cid:5) Gb) (cid:2) 0. Thus, the total linear momentum G (cid:2) Ga (cid:5) Gb for the system of the two particles remains constant during the interval, and we write (cid:6)G (cid:2) 0 or G1 (cid:2) G2 (3/28) Equation 3/28 expresses the principle of conservation of linear momentum. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 194 194 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/19 A tennis player strikes the tennis ball with her racket when the ball is at the uppermost point of its trajectory as shown.

First, we deﬁne the term angular momentum. Figure 3/14a shows a particle P of mass m moving along a curve in space. The particle is located by its position vector r with respect to a convenient origin O of ﬁxed coordinates x-y-z. The velocity of the particle is v (cid:2) , and its linear momentum is G (cid:2) mv. The moment of the linear momentum vector mv about the origin O is deﬁned as the angular momentum HO of P about O and is given by the cross-product relation for the moment of a vector r˙ HO (cid:2) r (cid:3) mv (3/29) The angular momentum then is a vector perpendicular to the plane A deﬁned by r and v. The sense of HO is clearly deﬁned by the right-hand rule for cross products. The scalar components of angular momentum may be obtained from the expansion z A H O = r mv r mv θ P y O x (a) mv HO = mvr sinθ θ θ P r r sinθ HO (cid:2) r (cid:3) mv (cid:2) m(vz y (cid:3) vy z)i (cid:5) m(vx (cid:2) m(cid:3) i x vx (cid:3) z (cid:3) vz k z vz x)j (cid:5) m(vy x (cid:3) vx y)k View in plane A (3/30) (b) Figure 3/14 j y vy H O so that Hx (cid:2) m(vz y (cid:3) vy z) Hy (cid:2) m(vx z (cid:3) vz x) Hz (cid:2) m(vy x (cid:3) vx y) Each of these expressions for angular momentum may be checked easily from Fig. 3/15, which shows the three linear-momentum components, by taking the moments of these components about the respective axes. To help visualize angular momentum, we show in Fig. 3/14b a two- dimensional representation in plane A of the vectors shown in part a of the ﬁgure. The motion is viewed in plane A deﬁned by r and v. The mag- nitude of the moment of mv about O is simply the linear momentum mv times the moment arm r sin (cid:5) or mvr sin (cid:5), which is the magnitude of the cross product HO (cid:2) r (cid:3) mv. Angular momentum is the moment of linear momentum and must not be confused with linear momentum. In SI units, angular momentum has the units . In the U.S. customary system, angular momentum has the units [lb/(ft/sec2)][ft/sec][ft] (cid:2) lb-ft-sec. kg (cid:2) (m/s) (cid:2) m (cid:2) kg (cid:2) m2/s (cid:2) N (cid:2) m (cid:2) s Rate of Change of Angular Momentum We are now ready to relate the moment of the forces acting on the particle P to its angular momentum. If ΣF represents the resultant of all forces acting on the particle P of Fig. 3/14, the moment MO about the origin O is the vector cross product ΣMO (cid:2) r (cid:3) ΣF (cid:2) r (cid:3) mv˙ mvz m r z y x y z O mvy mvx x Figure 3/15 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 206 206 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles where Newton’s second law ΣF (cid:2) m has been substituted. We now dif- v˙ ferentiate Eq. 3/29 with time, using the rule for the differentiation of a cross product (see item 9, Art. C/7, Appendix C) and obtain H˙ O (cid:2) r˙ (cid:3) mv (cid:5) r (cid:3) mv˙ (cid:2) v (cid:3) mv (cid:5) r (cid:3) mv˙ The term v (cid:3) mv is zero since the cross product of parallel vectors is identically zero. Substitution into the expression for ΣMO gives ΣMO (cid:2) H˙ O (3/31) Equation 3/31 states that the moment about the ﬁxed point O of all forces acting on m equals the time rate of change of angular momentum of m about O. This relation, particularly when extended to a system of particles, rigid or nonrigid, provides one of the most powerful tools of analysis in dynamics. Equation 3/31 is a vector equation with scalar components ΣMOx (cid:2) H˙ Ox ΣMOy (cid:2) H˙ Oy ΣMOz (cid:2) H˙ Oz (3/32) The Angular Impulse-Momentum Principle Equation 3/31 gives the instantaneous relation between the mo- ment and the time rate of change of angular momentum. To obtain the effect of the moment ΣMO on the angular momentum of the particle over a ﬁnite period of time, we integrate Eq. 3/31 from time t1 to time t2. Multiplying the equation by dt gives ΣMO dt (cid:2) dHO, which we integrate to obtain (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣMO dt (cid:2) (HO)2 (cid:3) (HO)1 (cid:2) (cid:6)HO (3/33) where (HO)2 (cid:2) r2 (cid:3) mv2 and (HO)1 (cid:2) r1 (cid:3) mv1. The product of moment and time is deﬁned as angular impulse, and Eq. 3/33 states that the total angular impulse on m about the ﬁxed point O equals the corre- sponding change in angular momentum of m about O. Alternatively, we may write Eq. 3/33 as (HO)1 (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣMO dt (cid:2) (HO)2 (3/33a) which states that the initial angular momentum of the particle plus the angular impulse applied to it equals its final angular momentum. The units of angular impulse are clearly those of angular momentum, which are in SI units and lb-ft-sec in U.S. custom- ary units. kg (cid:2) m2/s N (cid:2) m (cid:2) s or As in the case of linear impulse and linear momentum, the equation of angular impulse and angular momentum is a vector equation where changes in direction as well as magnitude may occur during the interval of integration. Under these conditions, it is necessary to express ΣMO c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 207 Article 3/10 Angular Impulse and Angular Momentum 207 and HO in component form and then combine the integrated compo- nents. The x-component of Eq. 3/33a is (HOx )1 (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 z)1 (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 t1 t1 ΣMOx ΣMOx dt (cid:2) (HOx )2 dt (cid:2) m(vz y (cid:3) vy z)2 (3/33b) or m(vz y (cid:3) vy where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the values of the respective quantities at times t1 and t2. Similar expressions exist for the y- and z-components of the angular impulse-momentum equation. Plane-Motion Applications The foregoing angular-impulse and angular-momentum relations have been developed in their general three-dimensional forms. Most of the ap- plications of interest to us, however, can be analyzed as plane-motion prob- lems where moments are taken about a single axis normal to the plane of motion. In this case, the angular momentum may change magnitude and sense, but the direction of the vector remains unaltered. Thus, for a particle of mass m moving along a curved path in the x-y plane, Fig. 3/16, the angular momenta about O at points 1 and 2 have the (HO)1 (cid:2) (cid:2)r1 (cid:3) mv1 (cid:2) (cid:2)r2 (cid:3) mv2(cid:2) (cid:2) magnitudes (HO)2 mv2d2, respectively. In the illustration both are repre- sented in the counterclockwise sense in accord with the direction of the moment of the linear momentum. The scalar form of Eq. 3/33a applied to the motion between points 1 and 2 during the time interval t1 to t2 becomes (cid:2) mv1d1 and (HO)2 (HO)1 and (cid:2) mv1d1 (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣFr sin (cid:5) dt (cid:2) mv2d2 (HO)1 (cid:5) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣMO dt (cid:2) (HO)2 or y mv2 2 r2 d2 θ ΣF (HO)2 = mv2d2 r d1 r1 O (HO)1 = mv1d1 Σ MO = Σ Fr sin θ Figure 3/16 mv1 1 x c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 208 208 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles This example should help clarify the relation between the scalar and vector forms of the angular impulse-momentum relations. Whereas Eq. 3/33 clearly stresses that the external angular impulse causes a change in the angular momentum, the order of the terms in Eqs. 3/33a and 3/33b corresponds to the natural sequence of events. Equation 3/33a is analogous to Eq. 3/27a, just as Eq. 3/31 is analogous to Eq. 3/25. As was the case for linear-momentum problems, we encounter im- pulsive (large magnitude, short duration) and nonimpulsive forces in angular-momentum problems. The treatment of these forces was dis- cussed in Art. 3/9. Equations 3/25 and 3/31 add no new basic information since they are merely alternative forms of Newton’s second law. We will discover in subsequent chapters, however, that the motion equations expressed in terms of the time rate of change of momentum are applicable to the motion of rigid and nonrigid bodies and provide a very general and pow- erful approach to many problems. The full generality of Eq. 3/31 is usu- ally not required to describe the motion of a single particle or the plane motion of rigid bodies, but it does have important use in the analysis of the space motion of rigid bodies introduced in Chapter 7. Conservation of Angular Momentum If the resultant moment about a ﬁxed point O of all forces acting on a particle is zero during an interval of time, Eq. 3/31 requires that its angular momentum HO about that point remain constant. In this case, the angular momentum of the particle is said to be conserved. Angular momentum may be conserved about one axis but not about another axis. A careful examination of the free-body diagram of the particle will disclose whether the moment of the resultant force on the particle about a ﬁxed point is zero, in which case, the angular momentum about that point is unchanged (conserved). Consider now the motion of two particles a and b which interact during an interval of time. If the interactive forces F and (cid:3)F between them are the only unbalanced forces acting on the particles during the interval, it follows that the moments of the equal and opposite forces about any ﬁxed point O not on their line of action are equal and oppo- site. If we apply Eq. 3/33 to particle a and then to particle b and add the two equations, we obtain (cid:6)Ha (cid:5) (cid:6)Hb (cid:2) 0 (where all angular momenta are referred to point O). Thus, the total angular momentum for the sys- tem of the two particles remains constant during the interval, and we write (cid:6)HO (cid:2) 0 or (HO)1 (cid:2) (HO)2 (3/34) which expresses the principle of conservation of angular momentum. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 209 SAMPLE PROBLEM 3/24 Article 3/10 Angular Impulse and Angular Momentum 209 A small sphere has the position and velocity indicated in the ﬁgure and is acted upon by the force F.

This treatment included the direct use of Newton’s second law, the equations of work and energy, and the equations of impulse and momentum. We paid special attention to the kind of problem for which each of the ap- proaches was most appropriate. Several topics of specialized interest in particle kinetics will be brieﬂy treated in Section D: 1. Impact 2. Central-force motion 3. Relative motion These topics involve further extension and application of the fundamen- tal principles of dynamics, and their study will help to broaden your background in mechanics. 3/12 Impact The principles of impulse and momentum have important use in de- scribing the behavior of colliding bodies. Impact refers to the collision between two bodies and is characterized by the generation of relatively large contact forces which act over a very short interval of time. It is im- portant to realize that an impact is a very complex event involving ma- terial deformation and recovery and the generation of heat and sound. Small changes in the impact conditions may cause large changes in the impact process and thus in the conditions immediately following the im- pact. Therefore, we must be careful not to rely heavily on the results of impact calculations. Direct Central Impact As an introduction to impact, we consider the collinear motion of two spheres of masses m1 and m2, Fig. 3/17a, traveling with velocities v1 and v2. If v1 is greater than v2, collision occurs with the contact forces di- rected along the line of centers. This condition is called direct central impact. Following initial contact, a short period of increasing deformation takes place until the contact area between the spheres ceases to in- crease. At this instant, both spheres, Fig. 3/17b, are moving with the same velocity v0. During the remainder of contact, a period of restora- tion occurs during which the contact area decreases to zero. In the ﬁnal condition shown in part c of the ﬁgure, the spheres now have new veloc- ities All velocities are arbi- trarily assumed positive to the right, so that with this scalar notation a velocity to the left would carry a negative sign. If the impact is not where must be less than v2 (cid:2), v2 (cid:2). and v1 (cid:2) v1 (cid:2) (a) Before impact (b) Maximum deformation during impact v1 > v2 m1 m2 v0 m1 m2 ′ v1 < ′ v2 (c) After impact m1 m2 Figure 3/17 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 218 218 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles Deformation period Restoration period v1 m1 v0 m1 ′ v1 Fd Fr v2 m2 v0 m2 ′ v2 Figure 3/18 overly severe and if the spheres are highly elastic, they will regain their original shape following the restoration. With a more severe impact and with less elastic bodies, a permanent deformation may result. Because the contact forces are equal and opposite during impact, the linear momentum of the system remains unchanged, as discussed in Art. 3/9. Thus, we apply the law of conservation of linear momentum and write m1v1 (cid:5) m2v2 (cid:2) m1v1 (cid:2) (cid:5) m2v2 (cid:2) (3/35) We assume that any forces acting on the spheres during impact, other than the large internal forces of contact, are relatively small and pro- duce negligible impulses compared with the impulse associated with each internal impact force. In addition, we assume that no appreciable change in the positions of the mass centers occurs during the short du- ration of the impact. Coefﬁcient of Restitution v1 (cid:2) and v2 (cid:2). For given masses and initial conditions, the momentum equation Clearly, we need an additional rela- contains two unknowns, tionship to ﬁnd the ﬁnal velocities. This relationship must reﬂect the ca- pacity of the contacting bodies to recover from the impact and can be expressed by the ratio e of the magnitude of the restoration impulse to the magnitude of the deformation impulse. This ratio is called the coefﬁ- cient of restitution. Let Fr and Fd represent the magnitudes of the contact forces dur- ing the restoration and deformation periods, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3/18. For particle 1 the definition of e together with the impulse- momentum equation give us e (cid:2) (cid:4) t (cid:4) t0 t0 0 Fr dt Fd dt (cid:2) m1[(cid:3)v1 (cid:2) (cid:3) ((cid:3)v0 )] m1[(cid:3)v0 (cid:3) ((cid:3)v1 )] (cid:2) v0 (cid:3) v1 (cid:2) v1 (cid:3) v0 Similarly, for particle 2 we have e (cid:2) (cid:4) t (cid:4) t0 t0 0 Fr dt Fd dt (cid:2) m2(v2 (cid:2) (cid:3) v0 ) m2(v0 (cid:3) v2 ) (cid:2) v2 (cid:2) (cid:3) v0 v0 (cid:3) v2 We are careful in these equations to express the change of momentum (and therefore (cid:6)v) in the same direction as the impulse (and thus the force). The time for the deformation is taken as t0 and the total time of contact is t. Eliminating v0 between the two expressions for e gives us e (cid:2) v2 (cid:2) (cid:3) v1 (cid:2) v1 (cid:3) v2 (cid:2) (cid:2)relative velocity of separation (cid:2) (cid:2)relative velocity of approach (cid:2) (3/36) ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 219 Article 3/12 Impact 219 Coefficient of restitution, e 1 0 0 Perfectly elastic Glass on glass Steel on steel Lead on lead Perfectly plastic Relative impact velocity Figure 3/19 If the two initial velocities v1 and v2 and the coefﬁcient of restitution e are known, then Eqs. 3/35 and 3/36 give us two equations in the two unknown ﬁnal velocities and v1 (cid:2) v2 (cid:2). Energy Loss During Impact Impact phenomena are almost always accompanied by energy loss, which may be calculated by subtracting the kinetic energy of the system just after impact from that just before impact. Energy is lost through the generation of heat during the localized inelastic deformation of the material, through the generation and dissipation of elastic stress waves within the bodies, and through the generation of sound energy. According to this classical theory of impact, the value e (cid:2) 1 means that the capacity of the two particles to recover equals their tendency to deform. This condition is one of elastic impact with no energy loss. The value e (cid:2) 0, on the other hand, describes inelastic or plastic impact where the particles cling together after collision and the loss of energy is a maxi- mum. All impact conditions lie somewhere between these two extremes. Also, it should be noted that a coefﬁcient of restitution must be as- sociated with a pair of contacting bodies. The coefﬁcient of restitution is frequently considered a constant for given geometries and a given com- bination of contacting materials. Actually, it depends on the impact ve- locity and approaches unity as the impact velocity approaches zero as shown schematically in Fig. 3/19. A handbook value for e is generally unreliable. Oblique Central Impact We now extend the relationships developed for direct central impact to the case where the initial and ﬁnal velocities are not parallel, Fig. 3/20. Here spherical particles of mass m1 and m2 have initial velocities v1 and v2 in the same plane and approach each other on a collision course, as shown in part a of the ﬁgure. The directions of the velocity vectors are measured from the direction tangent to the contacting surfaces, Fig. 3/20b. Thus, the initial velocity components along the t- and n-axes are (v1)n (cid:2) (cid:3)v1 sin (cid:5)1, (v1)t (cid:2) v1 cos (cid:5)1, (v2)n (cid:2) v2 sin (cid:5)2, m1 n m1 ′ v1 v1 θ 1 θ 2 v2 m2 ′θ 1 ′θ 2 t m2 ′ v2 |F| n F –F 0 0 t t0 Time, t (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 3/20 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 220 220 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles and (v2)t (cid:2) v2 cos (cid:5)2. Note that (v1)n is a negative quantity for the partic- ular coordinate system and initial velocities shown. The ﬁnal rebound conditions are shown in part c of the ﬁgure. The impact forces are F and (cid:3)F, as seen in part d of the ﬁgure. They vary from zero to their peak value during the deformation portion of the im- pact and back again to zero during the restoration period, as indicated in part e of the ﬁgure where t is the duration of the impact interval. For given initial conditions of m1, m2, (v1)n, (v1)t, (v2)n, and (v2)t, The and there will be four unknowns, namely, four needed equations are obtained as follows: (v1 (cid:2))n, (v2 (cid:2))n, (v1 (cid:2))t , (v2 (cid:2))t . (1) Momentum of the system is conserved in the n-direction. This gives m1(v1 )n (cid:5) m2(v2 )n (cid:2) m1(v1 (cid:2))n (cid:5) m2(v2 (cid:2))n (2) and (3) The momentum for each particle is conserved in the t-direction since there is no impulse on either particle in the t-direction. Thus, m1(v1 m2(v2 )t (cid:2) m1(v1 (cid:2))t )t (cid:2) m2(v2 (cid:2))t (4) The coefﬁcient of restitution, as in the case of direct central im- pact, is the positive ratio of the recovery impulse to the deformation im- pulse. Equation 3/36 applies, then, to the velocity components in the n-direction.

The most common example of central-force motion is the orbital movement of planets and satellites. The laws which govern this motion were deduced from observation of the motions of the planets by J. Kepler (1571–1630). An understanding of central-force motion is required to design high-altitude rockets, earth satellites, and space vehicles. Motion of a Single Body Consider a particle of mass m, Fig. 3/21, moving under the action of the central gravitational attraction F (cid:2) G mm0 r2 where m0 is the mass of the attracting body, which is assumed to be ﬁxed, G is the universal gravitational constant, and r is the distance be- tween the centers of the masses. The particle of mass m could represent the earth moving about the sun, the moon moving about the earth, or a satellite in its orbital motion about the earth above the atmosphere. The most convenient coordinate system to use is polar coordinates in the plane of motion since F will always be in the negative r-direction and there is no force in the (cid:5)-direction. Equations 3/8 may be applied directly for the r- and (cid:5)-directions to give (cid:3)G mm0 r2 (cid:2) m(r¨ (cid:3) r (cid:5)˙2) 0 (cid:2) m(r (cid:5)¨ (cid:5) 2r˙(cid:5)˙ ) (3/37) The second of the two equations when multiplied by r/m is seen to be the same as d(r2 )/dt (cid:2) 0, which is integrated to give (cid:5)˙ r2 (cid:5)˙ (cid:2) h, a constant (3/38) (cid:5)˙ The physical signiﬁcance of Eq. 3/38 is made clear when we note that the angular momentum r (cid:3) mv of m about m0 has the magnitude mr2 . Thus, Eq. 3/38 merely states that the angular momentum of m about m0 remains constant (is conserved). This statement is easily de- duced from Eq. 3/31, which shows that the angular momentum HO re- mains constant (is conserved) if there is no moment acting on the particle about a ﬁxed point O. We observe that during time dt, the radius vector sweeps out an (1 (r d(cid:5)). Therefore, the rate at area, shaded in Fig. 3/21, equal to dA (cid:2) r) 2 A˙ (cid:2) 1 which area is swept by the radius vector is , which is constant ac- 2 cording to Eq. 3/38. This conclusion is expressed in Kepler’s second law of planetary motion, which states that the areas swept through in equal times are equal. r2 (cid:5)˙ c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 231 Article 3/13 Central-Force Motion 231 The shape of the path followed by m may be obtained by solving the ﬁrst of Eqs. 3/37, with the time t eliminated through combination with Eq. 3/38. To this end the mathematical substitution r (cid:2) 1/u is useful. u˙/ (cid:5)˙ ) or (cid:2) Thus, (cid:2) (cid:3)(1/u2) , which from Eq. 3/38 becomes (cid:2) (cid:3)h( r˙ (cid:5)˙ (cid:3)h(du/d(cid:5)). The second time derivative is (cid:2) (cid:3)h(d2u/d(cid:5)2) , which by combining with Eq. 3/38, becomes (cid:2) (cid:3)h2u2(d2u/d(cid:5)2). Substitution into r¨ the ﬁrst of Eqs. 3/37 now gives u˙ r˙ r¨ r˙ (cid:3)Gm0u2 (cid:2) (cid:3)h2 u2 d2 u d(cid:5)2 (cid:3) 1 u h2u4 or d2 u d(cid:5)2 (cid:5) u (cid:2) Gm0 h2 (3/39) which is a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation.

The phase angle (cid:11) may be eliminated by choosing the x-axis so that r is a minimum when (cid:5) (cid:2) 0. Thus, (cid:2) C cos (cid:5) (cid:5) 1 r Gm0 h2 (3/40) Conic Sections The interpretation of Eq. 3/40 requires a knowledge of the equa- tions for conic sections. We recall that a conic section is formed by the locus of a point which moves so that the ratio e of its distance from a point (focus) to a line (directrix) is constant. Thus, from Fig. 3/21, e (cid:2) r/(d (cid:3) r cos (cid:5)), which may be rewritten as Hyperbola e > 1 Parabola e = 1 Ellipse e < 1 (cid:2) 1 r 1 d cos (cid:5) (cid:5) 1 ed Circle e = 0 m0 (3/41) 2b Apogee m v r θ Perigee which is the same form as Eq. 3/40.

From Eq. 3/41 we deduce that r is a mini- mum when (cid:5) (cid:2) 0 and is a maximum when (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:6). Thus, 2a (cid:2) rmin (cid:5) rmax (cid:2) ed 1 (cid:5) e (cid:5) ed 1 (cid:3) e or a (cid:2) ed 1 (cid:3) e2 With the distance d expressed in terms of a, Eq. 3/41 and the maximum and minimum values of r may be written as (cid:2) 1 r 1 (cid:5) e cos (cid:5) a(1 (cid:3) e2) (3/43) rmin (cid:2) a(1 (cid:3) e) rmax (cid:2) a(1 (cid:5) e) (cid:3)1 (cid:3) e2 In addition, the relation b (cid:2) a , which comes from the geometry of the ellipse, gives the expression for the semiminor axis. We see that the ellipse becomes a circle with r (cid:2) a when e (cid:2) 0. Equation 3/43 is an expression of Kepler’s ﬁrst law, which says that the planets move in el- liptical orbits around the sun as a focus.

Next, combining the expressions for rmin and rmax corresponding to perigee and apogee, Eq. 3/43, with Eq. 3/47 results in a pair of expres- sions for the respective velocities at these two positions for the elliptical orbit: vP vA (cid:2) R(cid:2)g a (cid:2)1 (cid:3) e 1 (cid:4) e (cid:2) R(cid:2)g a (cid:2)1 (cid:4) e 1 (cid:3) e (cid:2) R (cid:2)g a (cid:2)rmax rmin (3/48) (cid:2) R (cid:2)g a (cid:2)rmin rmax Selected numerical data pertaining to the solar system are included in Appendix D and are useful in applying the foregoing relationships to problems in planetary motion. Summary of Assumptions The foregoing analysis is based on three assumptions: 1. The two bodies possess spherical mass symmetry so that they may be treated as if their masses were concentrated at their centers, that is, as if they were particles. 2. There are no forces present except the gravitational force which each mass exerts on the other. 3. Mass m0 is ﬁxed in space. Assumption (1) is excellent for bodies which are distant from the cen- tral attracting body, which is the case for most heavenly bodies. A sig- nificant class of problems for which assumption (1) is poor is that of artificial satellites in the very near vicinity of oblate planets. As a comment on assumption (2), we note that aerodynamic drag on a low- altitude earth satellite is a force which usually cannot be ignored in the orbital analysis. For an artificial satellite in earth orbit, the error of assumption (3) is negligible because the ratio of the mass of the satellite to that of the earth is very small. On the other hand, for the earth–moon system, a small but significant error is introduced if as- sumption (3) is invoked—note that the lunar mass is about 1/81 times that of the earth. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:39 PM Page 235 Article 3/13 Central-Force Motion 235 mm0——– F = G r r3 – F r P m0 r1 m P r2 Figure 3/24 Perturbed Two-Body Problem We now account for the motion of both masses and allow the pres- ence of other forces in addition to those of mutual attraction by consid- ering the perturbed two-body problem. Figure 3/24 depicts the major mass m0, the minor mass m, their respective position vectors r1 and r2 measured relative to an inertial frame, the gravitation forces F and (cid:3)F, and a non-two-body force P which is exerted on mass m. The force P may be due to aerodynamic drag, solar pressure, the presence of a third body, on-board thrusting activities, a nonspherical gravitational ﬁeld, or a combination of these and other sources. Application of Newton’s second law to each mass results in G mm0 r3 r (cid:2) m0r¨1 and (cid:3)G mm0 r3 r (cid:5) P (cid:2) mr¨2 Dividing the ﬁrst equation by m0, the second equation by m, and sub- tracting the ﬁrst equation from the second give (cid:3)G (m0 (cid:5) m) r3 r (cid:5) P m (cid:2) r¨2 (cid:3) r¨1 (cid:2) r¨ or r¨ (cid:5) G (m0 (cid:5) m) r3 r (cid:2) P m (3/49) Equation 3/49 is a second-order differential equation which, when solved, yields the relative position vector r as a function of time. Numer- ical techniques are usually required for the integration of the scalar dif- ferential equations which are equivalent to the vector equation 3/49, especially if P is nonzero. Restricted Two-Body Problem If m0 (cid:4)(cid:4) m and P (cid:2) 0, we have the restricted two-body problem, the equation of motion of which is r¨ (cid:5) G m0 r3 r (cid:2) 0 (3/49a) With r and expressed in polar coordinates, Eq. 3/49a becomes r¨ (r¨ (cid:3) r (cid:5)˙2)er (cid:5) (r (cid:5)¨ (cid:5) 2r˙(cid:5)˙)e(cid:5) (cid:5) G m0 r3 (rer) (cid:2) 0 When we equate coefﬁcients of like unit vectors, we recover Eqs. 3/37. Comparison of Eq. 3/49 (with P (cid:2) 0) and Eq. 3/49a enables us to relax the assumption that mass m0 is ﬁxed in space. If we replace m0 by (m0 (cid:5) m) in the expressions derived with the assumption of m0 ﬁxed, then we obtain expressions which account for the motion of m0. For ex- ample, the corrected expression for the period of elliptical motion of m about m0 is, from Eq. 3/44, a3/2 (cid:3)G(m0 (cid:5) m) where the equality R2g (cid:2) Gm0 has been used.

The nearest we can come to a “ﬁxed” reference system is the primary inertial system or astronomical frame of reference, which is an imaginary set of axes attached to the ﬁxed stars. All other reference sys- tems then are considered to have motion in space, including any refer- ence system attached to the moving earth. The acceleration of points attached to the earth as measured in the primary system are quite small, however, and we normally neglect them for most earth-surface measurements. For example, the acceleration of the center of the earth in its near-circular orbit around the sun consid- ered ﬁxed is 0.00593 m/s2 (or 0.01946 ft/sec2), and the acceleration of a point on the equator at sea level with respect to the center of the earth considered ﬁxed is 0.0339 m/s2 (or 0.1113 ft/sec2). Clearly, these acceler- ations are small compared with g and with most other signiﬁcant accel- erations in engineering work. Thus, we make only a small error when we assume that our earth-attached reference axes are equivalent to a ﬁxed reference system. Z ΣF z m A rA/B = rrel y rA Y O rB B Relative-Motion Equation We now consider a particle A of mass m, Fig. 3/25, whose motion is observed from a set of axes x-y-z which translate with respect to a ﬁxed reference frame X-Y-Z. Thus, the x-y-z directions always remain parallel to the X-Y-Z directions. We postpone discussion of motion relative to a rotating reference system until Arts. 5/7 and 7/7. The acceleration of the origin B of x-y-z is aB. The acceleration of A as observed from or relative to x-y-z is arel (cid:2) aA/B (cid:2) A/B, and by the relative-motion principle of Art. 2/8, the absolute acceleration of A is r¨ X x aA (cid:2) aB (cid:5) arel Figure 3/25 Thus, Newton’s second law ΣF (cid:2) maA becomes Y Y y a a X m Σ F (a) – ma x X m ΣF (b) Figure 3/26 ΣF (cid:2) m(aB (cid:5) arel) (3/50) We can identify the force sum ΣF, as always, by a complete free-body diagram. This diagram will appear the same to an observer in x-y-z or to one in X-Y-Z as long as only the real forces acting on the particle are rep- resented. We can conclude immediately that Newton’s second law does not hold with respect to an accelerating system since ΣF (cid:3) marel. D’Alembert’s Principle The particle acceleration we measure from a ﬁxed set of axes X-Y-Z, Fig. 3/26a, is its absolute acceleration a. In this case the familiar rela- tion ΣF (cid:2) ma applies. When we observe the particle from a moving c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:40 PM Page 245 Article 3/14 Relative Motion 245 system x-y-z attached to the particle, Fig. 3/26b, the particle necessar- ily appears to be at rest or in equilibrium in x-y-z. Thus, the observer who is accelerating with x-y-z concludes that a force (cid:3)ma acts on the particle to balance ΣF. This point of view, which allows the treatment of a dynamics problem by the methods of statics, was an outgrowth of the work of D’Alembert contained in his Traité de Dynamique pub- lished in 1743. This approach merely amounts to rewriting the equation of motion as ΣF (cid:3) ma (cid:2) 0, which assumes the form of a zero force summation if (cid:3)ma is treated as a force. This ﬁctitious force is known as the inertia force, and the artiﬁcial state of equilibrium created is known as dynamic equilibrium. The apparent transformation of a problem in dynamics to one in statics has become known as D’Alembert’s principle. Opinion differs concerning the original interpretation of D’Alem- bert’s principle, but the principle in the form in which it is generally known is regarded in this book as being mainly of historical interest. It evolved when understanding and experience with dynamics were ex- tremely limited and was a means of explaining dynamics in terms of the principles of statics, which were more fully understood. This excuse for using an artiﬁcial situation to describe a real one is no longer justiﬁed, as today a wealth of knowledge and experience with dynamics strongly supports the direct approach of thinking in terms of dynamics rather than statics. It is somewhat difﬁcult to understand the long persistence in the acceptance of statics as a way of understanding dynamics, partic- ularly in view of the continued search for the understanding and de- scription of physical phenomena in their most direct form. We cite only one simple example of the method known as D’Alem- bert’s principle. The conical pendulum of mass m, Fig. 3/27a, is swinging in a horizontal circle, with its radial line r having an angular velocity (cid:2). In the straightforward application of the equation of motion ΣF (cid:2) man in the direction n of the acceleration, the free-body diagram in part b of the ﬁgure shows that T sin (cid:5) (cid:2) mr(cid:2)2. When we apply the equilibrium require- ment in the y-direction, T cos (cid:5) (cid:3) mg (cid:2) 0, we can ﬁnd the unknowns T and (cid:5). But if the reference axes are attached to the particle, the particle will appear to be in equilibrium relative to these axes. Accordingly, the in- ertia force (cid:3)ma must be added, which amounts to visualizing the applica- tion of mr(cid:2)2 in the direction opposite to the acceleration, as shown in part c of the ﬁgure. With this pseudo free-body diagram, a zero force summa- tion in the n-direction gives T sin (cid:5) (cid:3) mr(cid:2)2 (cid:2) 0 which, of course, gives us the same result as before. We may conclude that no advantage results from this alternative formulation. The authors recommend against using it since it intro- duces no simpliﬁcation and adds a nonexistent force to the diagram. In the case of a particle moving in a circular path, this hypothetical inertia force is known as the centrifugal force since it is directed away from the center and is opposite to the direction of the acceleration. You are urged to recognize that there is no actual centrifugal force acting on the particle. The only actual force which may properly be called cen- trifugal is the horizontal component of the tension T exerted by the particle on the cord. θ h l r ω (a) T y θ T y θ n n mr 2ω mg (b) mg (c) Figure 3/27 c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:40 PM Page 246 246 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles ΣF Path relative to x-y-z m drrel vrel Z z aA = arel rrel y O Y B X x Figure 3/28 Constant-Velocity, Nonrotating Systems In discussing particle motion relative to moving reference systems, we should note the special case where the reference system has a con- stant velocity and no rotation. If the x-y-z axes of Fig. 3/25 have a con- stant velocity, then aB (cid:2) 0 and the acceleration of the particle is aA (cid:2) arel. Therefore, we may write Eq. 3/50 as ΣF (cid:2) marel (3/51) which tells us that Newton’s second law holds for measurements made in a system moving with a constant velocity. Such a system is known as an inertial system or as a Newtonian frame of reference. Observers in the moving system and in the ﬁxed system will also agree on the desig- nation of the resultant force acting on the particle from their identical free-body diagrams, provided they avoid the use of any so-called “inertia forces.” We will now examine the parallel question concerning the validity of the work-energy equation and the impulse-momentum equation relative to a constant-velocity, nonrotating system. Again, we take the x-y-z axes of Fig. 3/25 to be moving with a constant velocity vB (cid:2) relative to the ﬁxed axes X-Y-Z. The path of the particle A relative to x-y-z is governed by rrel and is represented schematically in Fig. 3/28. The work done by ΣF rela- tive to x-y-z is dUrel (cid:2) . But ΣF (cid:2) maA (cid:2) marel since aB (cid:2) 0. Also ΣF (cid:2) drrel for the same reason that at ds (cid:2) v dv in Art. 2/5 on (cid:2) dvrel (cid:2) drrel (cid:2) vrel arel curvilinear motion. Thus, we have r˙B dUrel (cid:2) marel (cid:2) drrel (cid:2) mvrel dvrel (cid:2) d(1 2 mvrel 2) We deﬁne the kinetic energy relative to x-y-z as Trel (cid:2) that we now have 1 2 2 mvrel so dUrel (cid:2) dTrel or Urel (cid:2) (cid:6)Trel (3/52) which shows that the work-energy equation holds for measurements made relative to a constant-velocity, nonrotating system. Relative to x-y-z, the impulse on the particle during time dt is ΣF dt (cid:2) maA dt (cid:2) marel dt. But marel dt (cid:2) m dvrel (cid:2) d(mvrel) so ΣF dt (cid:2) d(mvrel) We deﬁne the linear momentum of the particle relative to x-y-z as Grel (cid:2) mvrel, which gives us ΣF dt (cid:2) dGrel. Dividing by dt and integrating give ΣF (cid:2) G˙ rel and (cid:4) ΣF dt (cid:2) (cid:6)Grel (3/53) Thus, the impulse-momentum equations for a ﬁxed reference system also hold for measurements made relative to a constant-velocity, nonro- tating system. Finally, we define the relative angular momentum of the parti- cle about a point in x-y-z, such as the origin B, as the moment of the c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:40 PM Page 247 Article 3/14 Relative Motion 247 (H˙ B)rel (cid:2) r˙rel (cid:3) Grel (cid:5) rrel (cid:3) G˙ . The time derivative relative linear momentum. Thus, gives . The ﬁrst term is nothing more than vrel (cid:3) mvrel (cid:2) 0, and the second term becomes rrel (cid:3) ΣF (cid:2) ΣMB, the sum of the moments about B of all forces on m. Thus, we have (HB)rel (cid:2) rrel (cid:3) Grel rel ΣMB (cid:2) (H˙ B)rel (3/54) which shows that the moment-angular momentum relation holds with respect to a constant-velocity, nonrotating system. Although the work-energy and impulse-momentum equations hold relative to a system translating with a constant velocity, the individual expressions for work, kinetic energy, and momentum differ between the ﬁxed and the moving systems. Thus, (dU (cid:2) ΣF (cid:2) drA) (cid:3) (dUrel (cid:2) ΣF (cid:2) drrel) (T (cid:2) 1 2 mvA 2) (cid:3) (Trel (cid:2) 1 2 mvrel (G (cid:2) mvA) (cid:3) (Grel (cid:2) mvrel) 2) Equations 3/51 through 3/54 are formal proof of the validity of the Newtonian equations of kinetics in any constant-velocity, nonrotating system. We might have surmised these conclusions from the fact that ΣF (cid:2) ma depends on acceleration and not velocity. We are also ready to conclude that there is no experiment which can be conducted in and rel- ative to a constant-velocity, nonrotating system (Newtonian frame of reference) which discloses its absolute velocity. Any mechanical experi- ment will achieve the same results in any Newtonian system.

This experience is central to the study of dy- namics and lays the foundation for the subsequent study of rigid-body and nonrigid-body dynamics. These three methods are summarized as follows: 1. Direct Application of Newton’s Second Law First, we applied Newton’s second law ΣF (cid:2) ma to determine the instantaneous relation between forces and the acceleration they pro- duce. With the background of Chapter 2 for identifying the kind of mo- tion and with the aid of our familiar free-body diagram to be certain that all forces are accounted for, we were able to solve a large variety of problems using x-y, n-t, and r-(cid:5) coordinates for plane-motion problems and x-y-z, r-(cid:5)-z, and R-(cid:5)-(cid:13) coordinates for space problems. 2. Work-Energy Equations Next, we integrated the basic equation of motion ΣF (cid:2) ma with re- spect to displacement and derived the scalar equations for work and en- ergy. These equations enable us to relate the initial and ﬁnal velocities to the work done during an interval by forces external to our deﬁned system. We expanded this approach to include potential energy, both elastic and gravitational. With these tools we discovered that the energy approach is especially valuable for conservative systems, that is, systems wherein the loss of energy due to friction or other forms of dissipation is negligible. 3. Impulse-Momentum Equations Finally, we rewrote Newton’s second law in the form of force equals time rate of change of linear momentum and moment equals time rate of change of angular momentum. Then we integrated these relations with respect to time and derived the impulse and momentum equations. These equations were then applied to motion intervals where the forces were functions of time. We also investigated the interactions between particles under conditions where the linear momentum is conserved and where the angular momentum is conserved. In the ﬁnal section of Chapter 3, we employed these three basic methods in speciﬁc application areas as follows: 1. We noted that the impulse-momentum method is convenient in de- veloping the relations governing particle impacts. 2. We observed that the direct application of Newton’s second law en- ables us to determine the trajectory properties of a particle under central-force attraction. 3. Finally, we saw that all three basic methods may be applied to parti- cle motion relative to a translating frame of reference. Successful solution of problems in particle kinetics depends on knowledge of the prerequisite particle kinematics. Furthermore, the principles of particle kinetics are required to analyze particle systems and rigid bodies, which are covered in the remainder of Dynamics. c03.qxd 2/9/12 7:40 PM Page 256 256 Chapter 3 Kinetics of Particles REVIEW PROBLEMS 3/317 The 4-kg slider is released from rest in position A and slides down the vertical-plane guide.

Although we focused primarily on the kinetics of a single particle in Chapter 3, we mentioned the motion of two particles, considered together as a system, when we discussed work- energy and impulse-momentum. Our next major step in the development of dynamics is to extend these principles, which we applied to a single particle, to describe the motion of a general system of particles. This extension will unify the re- maining topics of dynamics and enable us to treat the motion of both rigid bodies and nonrigid systems. Recall that a rigid body is a solid system of particles wherein the distances between particles remain essentially unchanged. The overall motions found with machines, land and air vehicles, rockets and space- craft, and many moving structures provide examples of rigid-body prob- lems. On the other hand, we may need to study the time-dependent changes in the shape of a nonrigid, but solid, body due to elastic or in- elastic deformations. Another example of a nonrigid body is a deﬁned mass of liquid or gaseous particles ﬂowing at a speciﬁed rate. Examples are the air and fuel ﬂowing through the turbine of an aircraft engine, the burned gases issuing from the nozzle of a rocket motor, or the water passing through a rotary pump. 267 c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 268 268 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles Although we can extend the equations for single-particle motion to a general system of particles without much difﬁculty, it is difﬁcult to un- derstand the generality and signiﬁcance of these extended principles without considerable problem experience. For this reason, you should frequently review the general results obtained in the following articles during the remainder of your study of dynamics. In this way, you will understand how these broader principles unify dynamics. KEY CONCEPTS 4/2 Generalized Newton’s Second Law We now extend Newton’s second law of motion to cover a general mass system which we model by considering n mass particles bounded by a closed surface in space, Fig. 4/1. This bounding envelope, for exam- ple, may be the exterior surface of a given rigid body, the bounding sur- face of an arbitrary portion of the body, the exterior surface of a rocket containing both rigid and ﬂowing particles, or a particular volume of ﬂuid particles. In each case, the system to be considered is the mass within the envelope, and that mass must be clearly deﬁned and isolated. Figure 4/1 shows a representative particle of mass mi of the system isolated with forces F1, F2, F3, . . . acting on mi from sources external to the envelope, and forces f1, f2, f3, . . . acting on mi from sources internal to the system boundary. The external forces are due to contact with ex- ternal bodies or to external gravitational, electric, or magnetic effects. The internal forces are forces of reaction with other mass particles within the boundary. The particle of mass mi is located by its position vector ri measured from the nonaccelerating origin O of a Newtonian set of reference axes.* The center of mass G of the isolated system of particles is located by the position vector which, from the deﬁnition of the mass center as covered in statics, is given by r mr (cid:2) Σmiri where the total system mass is m (cid:2) Σmi. The summation sign Σ repre- over all n particles. sents the summation Σn i(cid:2)1 F3 F2 F1 mi mi ri f3 G f2 f1 ρ i – r O System boundary Figure 4/1 F1 (cid:3) F2 (cid:3) F3 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) f1 (cid:3) f2 (cid:3) f3 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) mir¨i Newton’s second law, Eq. 3/3, when applied to mi gives r¨i is the acceleration of mi. A similar equation may be written for where each of the particles of the system. If these equations written for all par- ticles of the system are added together, the result is ΣF (cid:3) Σf (cid:2) Σmir¨i The term ΣF then becomes the vector sum of all forces acting on all particles of the isolated system from sources external to the system, and *It was shown in Art. 3/14 that any nonrotating and nonaccelerating set of axes constitutes a Newtonian reference system in which the principles of Newtonian mechanics are valid. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 269 Article 4/3 Work-Energy 269 Σf becomes the vector sum of all forces on all particles produced by the internal actions and reactions between particles. This last sum is identi- cally zero since all internal forces occur in pairs of equal and opposite twice actions and reactions. By differentiating the equation deﬁning r¨i with time, we have where m has a zero time derivative as long as mass is not entering or leaving the system.* Substitution into the summation of the equations of motion gives Σmi mr¨ (cid:2) r ΣF (cid:2) mr¨ or F (cid:2) ma (4/1) where a is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system. r¨ Equation 4/1 is the generalized Newton’s second law of motion for a mass system and is called the equation of motion of m. The equation states that the resultant of the external forces on any system of masses equals the total mass of the system times the acceleration of the center of mass. This law expresses the so-called principle of motion of the mass center. a Observe that is the acceleration of the mathematical point which represents instantaneously the position of the mass center for the given n particles. For a nonrigid body, this acceleration need not represent the acceleration of any particular particle. Note also that Eq. 4/1 holds for each instant of time and is therefore an instantaneous relationship. Equation 4/1 for the mass system had to be proved, as it cannot be in- ferred directly from Eq. 3/3 for a single particle. Equation 4/1 may be expressed in component form using x-y-z coor- dinates or whatever coordinate system is most convenient for the prob- lem at hand. Thus, ΣFx (cid:2) max ΣFy (cid:2) may ΣFz (cid:2) maz (4/1a) Although Eq. 4/1, as a vector equation, requires that the accelera- tion vector have the same direction as the resultant external force ΣF, it does not follow that ΣF necessarily passes through G. In general, in fact, ΣF does not pass through G, as will be shown later. a 4/3 Work-Energy In Art. 3/6 we developed the work-energy relation for a single parti- cle, and we noted that it applies to a system of two joined particles. Now consider the general system of Fig. 4/1, where the work-energy re- lation for the representative particle of mass mi is (U1-2)i (cid:2) (cid:4)Ti. Here (U1-2)i is the work done on mi during an interval of motion by all forces F1 (cid:3) F2 (cid:3) F3 (cid:3) applied from sources external to the system and by all forces f1 (cid:3) f2 (cid:3) f3 (cid:3) applied from sources internal to the system. The kinetic energy of mi is Ti (cid:2) 2 , where vi is the magnitude of the particle velocity vi (cid:2) .r˙i mivi (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) 1 2 *If m is a function of time, a more complex situation develops; this situation is discussed in Art. 4/7 on variable mass. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 270 270 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles fi –fi Figure 4/2 Work-Energy Relation For the entire system, the sum of the work-energy equations writ- ten for all particles is Σ(U1-2)i (cid:2) Σ(cid:4)Ti, which may be represented by the same expressions as Eqs. 3/15 and 3/15a of Art. 3/6, namely, U1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4)T or T1 (cid:3) U1-2 (cid:2) T2 (4/2) where U1-2 (cid:2) Σ(U1-2)i, the work done by all forces, external and internal, on all particles, and (cid:4)T is the change in the total kinetic energy T (cid:2) ΣTi of the system. For a rigid body or a system of rigid bodies joined by ideal friction- less connections, no net work is done by the internal interacting forces or moments in the connections. We see that the work done by all pairs of internal forces, labeled here as fi and (cid:5)fi, at a typical connection, Fig. 4/2, in the system is zero since their points of application have identical displacement components while the forces are equal but opposite. For this situation U1-2 becomes the work done on the system by the external forces only. For a nonrigid mechanical system which includes elastic members capable of storing energy, a part of the work done by the external forces goes into changing the internal elastic potential energy Ve. Also, if the work done by the gravity forces is excluded from the work term and is accounted for instead by the changes in gravitational potential energy U(cid:2) done on the system during an in- Vg, then we may equate the work 1-2 terval of motion to the change (cid:4)E in the total mechanical energy of the system. Thus, (cid:2) (cid:4)E or U(cid:2) 1-2 U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4)T (cid:3) (cid:4)V (4/3) or T1 (cid:3) V1 (cid:3) U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:2) T2 (cid:3) V2 (4/3a) which are the same as Eqs. 3/21 and 3/21a. Here, as in Chapter 3, V (cid:2) Vg (cid:3) Ve represents the total potential energy. Kinetic Energy Expression We now examine the expression T (cid:2) for the kinetic energy of the mass system in more detail. By our principle of relative motion discussed in Art. 2/8, we may write the velocity of the representative particle as 1 Σ 2 2 mivi vi (cid:2) v (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i v where is the velocity of mi with respect to a translating reference frame moving with the mass is the velocity of the mass center G and (cid:2)˙i c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 271 center G.

Linear Momentum From our deﬁnition in Art. 3/8, the linear momentum of the repre- sentative particle of the system depicted in Fig. 4/1 is Gi (cid:2) mivi where the velocity of mi is vi (cid:2) . r˙i The linear momentum of the system is deﬁned as the vector sum of the linear momenta of all of its particles, or G (cid:2) Σmivi. By substituting v (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i the relative-velocity relation vi (cid:2) and noting again that Σmi(cid:2)i (cid:2) m (cid:2) 0, we obtain (cid:2) G (cid:2) Σmi(v (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i) (cid:2) Σmiv (cid:3) d dt Σmi (cid:2) i (cid:2) v Σmi (cid:3) d dt (0) or G (cid:2) mv (4/5) Thus, the linear momentum of any system of constant mass is the prod- uct of the mass and the velocity of its center of mass. The time derivative of G is mv˙ (cid:2) ma , which by Eq. 4/1 is the resul- tant external force acting on the system. Thus, we have ΣF (cid:2) G˙ (4/6) c04.qxd 2/20/12 3:21 PM Page 272 272 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles which has the same form as Eq. 3/25 for a single particle. Equation 4/6 states that the resultant of the external forces on any mass system equals the time rate of change of the linear momentum of the system. It is an alternative form of the generalized second law of motion, Eq. 4/1. As was noted at the end of the last article, ΣF, in general, does not pass through the mass center G. In deriving Eq. 4/6, we differentiated with respect to time and assumed that the total mass is constant. Thus, the equation does not apply to systems whose mass changes with time. Angular Momentum We now determine the angular momentum of our general mass system about the fixed point O, about the mass center G, and about an arbitrary point P, shown in Fig. 4/3, which may have an acceleration aP (cid:2) . r¨P About a Fixed Point O. The angular momentum of the mass system about the point O, ﬁxed in the Newtonian reference system, is deﬁned as the vector sum of the moments of the linear momenta about O of all particles of the system and is HO (cid:2) Σ(ri (cid:2) mivi) H˙ O (cid:2) r˙i Σ(r˙i (cid:2) mivi) (cid:3) The time derivative of the vector product is Σ(ri (cid:2) miv˙i) . The ﬁrst summation vanishes since the cross product of two parallel vectors and mivi is zero. The second summation is Σ(ri (cid:2) miai) (cid:2) Σ(ri (cid:2) Fi), which is the vector sum of the moments about O of all forces acting on all particles of the system. This moment sum ΣMO represents only the moments of forces external to the system, since the internal forces cancel one another and their moments add up to zero. Thus, the moment sum is ΣMO (cid:2) H˙ O (4/7) which has the same form as Eq. 3/31 for a single particle.

As in the linear-momentum case, Eq. 4/7 does not apply if the total mass of the system is changing with time. About the Mass Center G. The angular momentum of the mass system about the mass center G is the sum of the moments of the linear momenta about G of all particles and is HG (cid:2) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mir˙i (4/8) We may write the absolute velocity r˙i (r˙ as (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i) so that HG becomes HG (cid:2) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi(r˙ (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i) (cid:2) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mir˙ (cid:3) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙i The first term on the right side of this equation may be rewritten as (cid:5)r˙ , which is zero because Σmi (cid:2)i (cid:2) 0 by definition of the mass i center. Thus, we have (cid:2) Σmi (cid:2) HG (cid:2) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙i (4/8a) r˙i The expression of Eq. 4/8 is called the absolute angular momentum is used. The expression of Eq. 4/8a is because the absolute velocity is called the relative angular momentum because the relative velocity used. With the mass center G as a reference, the absolute and relative angular momenta are seen to be identical. We will see that this identity does not hold for an arbitrary reference point P; there is no distinction for a ﬁxed reference point O. (cid:2)˙i Differentiating Eq. 4/8 with respect to time gives H˙ G (cid:2) Σ (cid:2)˙i (cid:2) mi(r˙ (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i) (cid:3) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mir¨i The ﬁrst summation is expanded as (cid:2) Σmi term may be rewritten as (cid:5)r˙ Σ (cid:2)˙i (cid:2)˙i (cid:2) mir˙ (cid:2) (cid:5)r˙ (cid:3) Σ (cid:2)˙i d Σmi (cid:2) dt (cid:2) mi (cid:2) i (cid:2)˙i . The ﬁrst , which is zero from the deﬁnition of the mass center. The second term is zero because the cross product of parallel vectors is zero. With Fi representing the sum of all external forces acting on mi and fi the sum of all internal forces acting on mi, the second summation by Newton’s second law be- comes Σ(cid:2)i (cid:2) (Fi (cid:3) fi) (cid:2) Σ(cid:2)i (cid:2) Fi (cid:2) ΣMG, the sum of all external mo- ments about point G. Recall that the sum of all internal moments Σ(cid:2)i (cid:2) fi is zero. Thus, we are left with ΣMG (cid:2) H˙ G (4/9) where we may use either the absolute or the relative angular momentum. Equations 4/7 and 4/9 are among the most powerful of the govern- ing equations in dynamics and apply to any deﬁned system of constant mass—rigid or nonrigid. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 274 274 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles About an Arbitrary Point P.

Thus, rearranging gives (cid:2) (cid:2) Σmir˙i (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) Σmivi (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) mv . The HP (cid:2) HG (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) mv (4/10) Equation 4/10 states that the absolute angular momentum about any point P equals the angular momentum about G plus the moment about P of the linear momentum of the system considered concentrated at G. mv ΣMG = G · H G –ρ P ΣF = ma– We now make use of the principle of moments developed in our study of statics where we represented a force system by a resultant force through any point, such as G, and a corresponding couple. Figure 4/4 represents the resultants of the external forces acting on the system ex- pressed in terms of the resultant force ΣF through G and the corre- sponding couple ΣMG. We see that the sum of the moments about P of all forces external to the system must equal the moment of their resul- tants. Therefore, we may write ΣMP (cid:2) ΣMG (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) ΣF which, by Eqs. 4/9 and 4/6, becomes Figure 4/4 ΣMP (cid:2) H˙ G (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) ma (4/11) Equation 4/11 enables us to write the moment equation about any con- venient moment center P and is easily visualized with the aid of Fig. 4/4. This equation forms a rigorous basis for much of our treatment of pla- nar rigid-body kinetics in Chapter 6. We may also develop similar momentum relationships by using the momentum relative to P. Thus, from Fig. 4/3 (HP)rel (cid:2) Σ(cid:2)(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙(cid:2) i (cid:2)˙(cid:2) where i (cid:2)(cid:2) i (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) i is the velocity of mi relative to P. With the substitution and we may write (cid:2)˙ (cid:2)˙(cid:2) i (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)˙i (HP)rel (cid:2) Σ(cid:2) (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙ (cid:3) Σ(cid:2) (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙i (cid:3) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙ (cid:3) Σ(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi (cid:2)˙i The ﬁrst summation is Σmi (cid:2) . The second summation is (cid:2) Σmi (cid:2) where both are zero by deﬁni- and the third summation is tion of the mass center. The fourth summation is (HG)rel. Rearranging gives us (cid:2) (cid:2) mvrel (cid:5)(cid:2)˙ (cid:2) (cid:2) i i d dt (HP)rel (cid:2) (HG)rel (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) mvrel (4/12) c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 275 Article 4/5 Conservation of Energy and Momentum 275 where (HG)rel is the same as HG (see Eqs. 4/8 and 4/8a). Note the simi- larity of Eqs. 4/12 and 4/10. The moment equation about P may now be expressed in terms of the angular momentum relative to P. We differentiate the deﬁnition (cid:3) (cid:2)¨(cid:2) (HP)rel (cid:2) to obtain with time and make the substitution (cid:2) i (cid:2) mi Σ(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)˙(cid:2) r¨P r¨i i i (H˙ p)rel (cid:2) Σ (cid:2)˙(cid:2) i (cid:2) mi i (cid:3) Σ(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)˙(cid:2) i (cid:2) mir¨i (cid:5) Σ(cid:2)(cid:2) i (cid:2) mir¨P The ﬁrst summation is identically zero, and the second summation is the sum ΣMP of the moments of all external forces about P.

The equation reduces to the simpler form 4/5 Conservation of Energy and Momentum Under certain common conditions, there is no net change in the total mechanical energy of a system during an interval of motion. Under other conditions, there is no net change in the momentum of a system. These conditions are treated separately as follows. Conservation of Energy A mass system is said to be conservative if it does not lose energy by virtue of internal friction forces which do negative work or by virtue of in- elastic members which dissipate energy upon cycling. If no work is done on a conservative system during an interval of motion by external forces (other than gravity or other potential forces), then none of the energy of 1-2 (cid:2) 0 the system is lost. For this case, and we may write Eq. 4/3 as U(cid:2) (cid:4)T (cid:3) (cid:4)V (cid:2) 0 (4/14) or T1 (cid:3) V1 (cid:2) T2 (cid:3) V2 (4/14a) which expresses the law of conservation of dynamical energy. The total energy E (cid:2) T (cid:3) V is a constant, so that E1 (cid:2) E2. This law holds only in the ideal case where internal kinetic friction is sufﬁciently small to be neglected. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 276 276 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles Conservation of Momentum If, for a certain interval of time, the resultant external force ΣF act- ing on a conservative or nonconservative mass system is zero, Eq. 4/6 re- quires that , so that during this interval G˙ (cid:2) 0 G1 (cid:2) G2 (4/15) which expresses the principle of conservation of linear momentum. Thus, in the absence of an external impulse, the linear momentum of a system remains unchanged. Similarly, if the resultant moment about a ﬁxed point O or about the mass center G of all external forces on any mass system is zero, Eq. 4/7 or 4/9 requires, respectively, that (HO)1 (cid:2) (HO)2 or (HG)1 (cid:2) (HG)2 (4/16) These relations express the principle of conservation of angular momen- tum for a general mass system in the absence of an angular impulse. Thus, if there is no angular impulse about a ﬁxed point (or about the mass center), the angular momentum of the system about the ﬁxed point (or about the mass center) remains unchanged. Either equation may hold without the other. We proved in Art. 3/14 that the basic laws of Newtonian mechanics hold for measurements made relative to a set of axes which translate with a constant velocity. Thus, Eqs. 4/1 through 4/16 are valid provided all quantities are expressed relative to the translating axes. Equations 4/1 through 4/16 are among the most important of the basic derived laws of mechanics. In this chapter we have derived these laws for the most general system of constant mass to establish the generality of these laws. Common applications of these laws are speciﬁc mass systems such as rigid and nonrigid solids and certain ﬂuid systems, which are dis- cussed in the following articles. Study these laws carefully and compare them with their more restricted forms encountered earlier in Chapter 3. . c n I r , s r e h c a e s e R o t o h P The principles of particle-system kinetics form the foundation for the study of the forces associated with the water-spraying equipment of these firefighting boats at the site of the Deep- water Horizon fire in the Gulf of Mexico. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 277 SAMPLE PROBLEM 4/1 Article 4/5 Conservation of Energy and Momentum 277 The system of four particles has the indicated particle r˙r , masses, positions, velocities, and external forces.

The dynamics of mass ﬂow is of great importance in the description of ﬂuid machinery of all types in- cluding turbines, pumps, nozzles, air-breathing jet engines, and rockets. The treatment of mass ﬂow in this article is not intended to take the place of a study of ﬂuid mechanics, but merely to present the basic prin- ciples and equations of momentum which ﬁnd important use in ﬂuid mechanics and in the general ﬂow of mass whether the form be liquid, gaseous, or granular. One of the most important cases of mass ﬂow occurs during steady- ﬂow conditions where the rate at which mass enters a given volume equals the rate at which mass leaves the same volume. The volume in question may be enclosed by a rigid container, ﬁxed or moving, such as the nozzle of a jet aircraft or rocket, the space between blades in a gas turbine, the volume within the casing of a centrifugal pump, or the vol- ume within the bend of a pipe through which a ﬂuid is ﬂowing at a steady rate. The design of such ﬂuid machines depends on the analysis of the forces and moments associated with the corresponding momen- tum changes of the ﬂowing mass. Analysis of Flow Through a Rigid Container Consider a rigid container, shown in section in Fig. 4/5a, into which mass ﬂows in a steady stream at the rate m(cid:2) through the entrance sec- tion of area A1. Mass leaves the container through the exit section of area A2 at the same rate, so that there is no accumulation or depletion of the total mass within the container during the period of observation. The velocity of the entering stream is v1 normal to A1 and that of the leaving stream is v2 normal to A2. If (cid:5)1 and (cid:5)2 are the respective densi- ties of the two streams, conservation of mass requires that 1A1v1 (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:5) 2 A2v2 (cid:2) m(cid:2) (4/17) To describe the forces which act, we isolate either the mass of ﬂuid within the container or the entire container and the ﬂuid within it. We would use the ﬁrst approach if the forces between the container and the ﬂuid were to be described, and we would adopt the second approach when the forces external to the container are desired. The latter situation is our primary interest, in which case, the sys- tem isolated consists of the ﬁxed structure of the container and the ﬂuid within it at a particular instant of time. This isolation is described by a free-body diagram of the mass within a closed volume deﬁned by the ex- terior surface of the container and the entrance and exit surfaces. We must account for all forces applied externally to this system, and in Fig. 4/5a the vector sum of this external force system is denoted by ΣF. In- cluded in ΣF are 1. the forces exerted on the container at points of its attachment to other structures, including attachments at A1 and A2, if present, ΣF A1 v1 ΣF A2 v2 d2 O d1 (a) ΣF Δ m Δ m Time t Time t + Δ t (b) Figure 4/5 c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 289 Article 4/6 Steady Mass Flow 289 2. the forces acting on the ﬂuid within the container at A1 and A2 due to any static pressure which may exist in the ﬂuid at these positions, and 3. the weight of the ﬂuid and structure if appreciable. The resultant ΣF of all of these external forces must equal , the time rate of change of the linear momentum of the isolated system. This statement follows from Eq. 4/6, which was developed in Art. 4/4 for any systems of constant mass, rigid or nonrigid. G˙ Incremental Analysis G˙ The expression for may be obtained by an incremental analysis. Figure 4/5b illustrates the system at time t when the system mass is that of the container, the mass within it, and an increment (cid:4)m about to enter during time (cid:4)t. At time t (cid:3) (cid:4)t the same total mass is that of the container, the mass within it, and an equal increment (cid:4)m which leaves the container in time (cid:4)t. The linear momentum of the container and mass within it between the two sections A1 and A2 remains unchanged during (cid:4)t so that the change in momentum of the system in time (cid:4)t is (cid:4)G (cid:2) ((cid:4)m)v2 (cid:5) ((cid:4)m)v1 (cid:2) (cid:4)m(v2 (cid:5) v1) Division by (cid:4)t and passage to the limit yield (cid:2) m(cid:2)(cid:4)v, where G˙ m(cid:2) (cid:2) lim (cid:4)tl0 (cid:3)(cid:4)m (cid:4)t (cid:4) (cid:2) dm dt Thus, by Eq. 4/6 ΣF (cid:2) m(cid:2)(cid:4)v (4/18) Equation 4/18 establishes the relation between the resultant force on a steady-ﬂow system and the corresponding mass ﬂow rate and vector ve- locity increment.* Alternatively, we may note that the time rate of change of linear momentum is the vector difference between the rate at which linear mo- mentum leaves the system and the rate at which linear momentum en- ters the system. Thus, we may write (cid:2) m(cid:2)v2 (cid:5) m(cid:2)v1 (cid:2) m(cid:2)(cid:4)v, which agrees with the foregoing result. G˙ We can now see one of the powerful applications of our general force-momentum equation which we derived for any mass system. Our system here includes a body which is rigid (the structural container for the mass stream) and particles which are in motion (the ﬂow of mass). By deﬁning the boundary of the system, the mass within which is con- stant for steady-ﬂow conditions, we are able to utilize the generality of Eq. 4/6. However, we must be very careful to account for all external *We must be careful not to interpret dm/dt as the time derivative of the mass of the isolated system. That derivative is zero since the system mass is constant for a steady-ﬂow process. To help avoid confusion, the symbol m(cid:2) rather than dm/dt is used to represent the steady mass ﬂow rate. . c n I , s e g a m I k e r t k c o t S The jet exhaust of this VTOL aircraft can be vectored downward for verti- cal takeoffs and landings. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 290 290 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles forces acting on the system, and they become clear if our free-body dia- gram is correct. Angular Momentum in Steady-Flow Systems A similar formulation is obtained for the case of angular momentum in steady-ﬂow systems. The resultant moment of all external forces about some ﬁxed point O on or off the system, Fig. 4/5a, equals the time rate of change of angular momentum of the system about O. This fact was established in Eq. 4/7 which, for the case of steady ﬂow in a single plane, becomes ΣMO (cid:2) m(cid:2)(v2 d2 (cid:5) v1d1) (4/19) When the velocities of the incoming and outgoing ﬂows are not in the same plane, the equation may be written in vector form as ΣMO (cid:2) m(cid:2)(d2 (cid:2) v2 (cid:5) d1 (cid:2) v1) (4/19a) where d1 and d2 are the position vectors to the centers of A1 and A2 from the ﬁxed reference O. In both relations, the mass center G may be used alternatively as a moment center by virtue of Eq. 4/9. Equations 4/18 and 4/19a are very simple relations which ﬁnd im- portant use in describing relatively complex ﬂuid actions. Note that these equations relate external forces to the resultant changes in mo- mentum and are independent of the ﬂow path and momentum changes internal to the system. The foregoing analysis may also be applied to systems which move with constant velocity by noting that the basic relations ΣF (cid:2) and ΣMO (cid:2) apply to systems moving with constant veloc- ity as discussed in Arts. 3/12 and 4/4. The only restriction is that the mass within the system remain constant with respect to time. or ΣMG (cid:2) H˙ O H˙ G G˙ Three examples of the analysis of steady mass ﬂow are given in the following sample problems, which illustrate the application of the prin- ciples embodied in Eqs. 4/18 and 4/19a. l y m a A / r e v a e W n b o R © i The principles of steady mass flow are critical to the design of this hovercraft. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 291 Article 4/6 Steady Mass Flow 291 SAMPLE PROBLEM 4/6 The smooth vane shown diverts the open stream of ﬂuid of cross-sectional area A, mass density (cid:5), and velocity v.

In the case of the moving vane, the ﬁnal velocity v(cid:2) of the ﬂuid upon exit is the vector sum of the velocity u of the vane plus the velocity of the ﬂuid relative to the vane v (cid:5) u. This combination is shown in the velocity diagram to the right of the ﬁgure for the exit conditions. The x-component of v(cid:2) is the sum of the components of its two parts, so (cid:2) (v (cid:5) u) cos (cid:2) (cid:3) u.

Solution. The force R shown with the ﬁgure for Sample Problem 4/6 is normal to the velocity of the vane so it does no work.

The second solution u (cid:2) v gives a minimum condition of zero power.

SAMPLE PROBLEM 4/8 The offset nozzle has a discharge area A at B and an inlet area A0 at C. A liquid enters the nozzle at a static gage pressure p through the ﬁxed pipe and is- sues from the nozzle with a velocity v in the direction shown. If the constant density of the liquid is (cid:5), write expressions for the tension T, shear Q, and bend- ing moment M in the pipe at C. Solution. The free-body diagram of the nozzle and the ﬂuid within it shows the tension T, shear Q, and bending moment M acting on the ﬂange of the nozzle where it attaches to the ﬁxed pipe. The force pA0 on the ﬂuid within the nozzle due to the static pressure is an additional external force. Continuity of ﬂow with constant density requires that Av (cid:2) A0v0 where v0 is the velocity of the ﬂuid at the entrance to the nozzle.

In the case of multiple vanes, such as the blades on a tur- bine disk, the rate at which ﬂuid is- sues from the nozzles is the same rate at which ﬂuid is undergoing momentum change. Thus, m(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:5)Av rather than (cid:5)A(v (cid:5) u).

Fuel is consumed at the constant rate ƒ The total aerodynamic forces acting on the aircraft are the lift L, normal to the di- rection of ﬂight, and the drag D, opposite to the direction of ﬂight. Any force due to the static pressure across the inlet and exhaust surfaces is assumed to be included in D. Write the equation for the motion of the aircraft and identify the thrust T. Solution. The free-body diagram of the aircraft together with the air, fuel, and exhaust gas within it is given and shows only the weight, lift, and drag forces as deﬁned. We attach axes x-y to the aircraft and apply our momentum equation relative to the moving system. (cid:2) (cid:3) The fuel will be treated as a steady stream entering the aircraft with no ve- locity relative to the system and leaving with a relative velocity u in the exhaust stream. We now apply Eq. 4/18 relative to the reference axes and treat the air and fuel ﬂows separately. For the air ﬂow, the change in velocity in the x-direction relative to the moving system is m′ gu (cid:4) (cid:4)va (cid:2) (cid:5)u (cid:5) ((cid:5)v) (cid:2) (cid:5)(u (cid:5) v) and for the fuel ﬂow the x-change in velocity relative to x-y is (cid:4)vƒ (cid:2) (cid:5)u (cid:5) (0) (cid:2) (cid:5)u T x θ D m′ av x y mg v L mg y D L mg D L Thus, we have [ΣFx (cid:2) m(cid:2)(cid:4)vx] (cid:5)mg sin (cid:2) (cid:5) D (cid:2) (cid:5)m(cid:2) a(u (cid:5) v) (cid:5) m(cid:2) ƒu gu (cid:3) m(cid:2) av (cid:2) (cid:5)m(cid:2) where the substitution m(cid:2) g (cid:2) m(cid:2) a (cid:3) m(cid:2) ƒ has been made. Changing signs gives m(cid:2) gu (cid:5) m(cid:2) av (cid:2) mg sin (cid:2) (cid:3) D which is the equation of motion of the system. If we modify the boundaries of our system to expose the interior surfaces on which the air and gas act, we will have the simulated model shown, where the air exerts a force on the interior of the turbine and the exhaust gas reacts against the interior surfaces with the force m(cid:2) av m(cid:2) . gu The commonly used model is shown in the ﬁnal diagram, where the net ef- fect of air and exhaust momentum changes is replaced by a simulated thrust (cid:5) T (cid:2) m(cid:2) gu (cid:5) m(cid:2) av Ans. applied to the aircraft from a presumed external source. Inasmuch as m(cid:2) ƒ g (cid:8) m(cid:2) a m(cid:2) proximation is generally only 2 percent or less of and express the thrust as m(cid:2) , we can use the ap- a T (cid:8) m(cid:2) g(u (cid:5) v) Ans. We have analyzed the case of constant velocity. Although our Newtonian principles do not generally hold relative to accelerating axes, it can be shown that we may use the F (cid:2) ma equation for the simulated model and write T (cid:5) mg sin (cid:2) (cid:5) D (cid:2) m with virtually no error. v˙ Helpful Hints (cid:2) Note that the boundary of the sys- tem cuts across the air stream at the entrance to the air scoop and across the exhaust stream at the nozzle. (cid:3) We are permitted to use moving axes which translate with constant velocity. See Arts. 3/14 and 4/2. (cid:4) Riding with the aircraft, we ob- serve the air entering our system with a velocity (cid:5)v measured in the plus x-direction and leaving the system with an x-velocity of (cid:5)u. The final value minus the initial one gives the expression cited, namely, (cid:5)u (cid:5) ((cid:5)v) (cid:2) (cid:5)(u (cid:5) v). (cid:5) We now see that the “thrust” is, in reality, not a force external to the entire airplane shown in the ﬁrst ﬁg- ure but can be modeled as an exter- nal force. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:33 PM Page 294 294 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles PROBLEMS Introductory Problems 4/35 The jet aircraft has a mass of 4.6 Mg and a drag (air resistance) of 32 kN at a speed of 1000 km/h at a particular altitude.

This extension led to the very general ex- and ΣMG (cid:2) pressions ΣF (cid:2) which are Eqs. 4/6, 4/7, and 4/9, respectively. In their derivation, the summations were taken over a ﬁxed collection of particles, so that the mass of the system to be analyzed was constant. ΣMO (cid:2) G˙ , H˙ H˙ O, G, In Art. 4/6 these momentum principles were extended in Eqs. 4/18 and 4/19a to describe the action of forces on a system deﬁned by a geo- metric volume through which passes a steady ﬂow of mass. Therefore, the amount of mass within this volume was constant with respect to time and thus we were able to use Eqs. 4/6, 4/7, and 4/9. When the mass within the boundary of a system under consideration is not constant, the foregoing relationships are no longer valid.* Equation of Motion We will now develop the equation for the linear motion of a system whose mass varies with time. Consider ﬁrst a body which gains mass by overtaking and swallowing a stream of matter, Fig. 4/6a. The mass of the body and its velocity at any instant are m and v, respectively. The stream of matter is assumed to be moving in the same direction as m with a constant velocity v0 less than v. By virtue of Eq. 4/18, the force exerted by m on the particles of the stream to accelerate them from a ve- locity v0 to a greater velocity v is R (cid:2) m(cid:2)(v (cid:5) v0) (cid:2) where the time rate of increase of m is m(cid:2) (cid:2) and where u is the magnitude of the rel- ative velocity with which the particles approach m. In addition to R, all other forces acting on m in the direction of its motion are denoted by m˙ u, m˙ ΣF ΣF ΣF v m v m v m v0 R m swallows mass (v > v0) (a) v0 R m expels mass (v > v0) v0 m0 m expels mass (v > v0) (b) (c) Figure 4/6 *In relativistic mechanics the mass is found to be a function of velocity, and its time deriva- tive has a meaning different from that in Newtonian mechanics. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:34 PM Page 304 304 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles . c n I , a c i r e m A k c o t s o t o F e g A / t e g o F r k c i r t a P © ΣF. The equation of motion of m from Newton’s second law is, there- fore, ΣF (cid:5) R (cid:2) or mv˙ ΣF (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:3) m˙ u (4/20) Similarly, if the body loses mass by expelling it rearward so that its velocity v0 is less than v, Fig. 4/6b, the force R required to decelerate the particles from a velocity v to a lesser velocity v0 is R (cid:2) m(cid:2)((cid:5)v0 (cid:5) [(cid:5)v]) (cid:2) m(cid:2)(v (cid:5) v0). But m(cid:2) (cid:2) since m is decreasing. Also, the relative veloc- ity with which the particles leave m is u (cid:2) v (cid:5) v0. Thus, the force R be- If ΣF denotes the resultant of all other forces acting comes R (cid:2) on m in the direction of its motion, Newton’s second law requires that ΣF (cid:3) R (cid:2) (cid:5)m˙ u. (cid:5)m˙ or mv˙ ΣF (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:3) m˙ u which is the same relationship as in the case where m is gaining mass. We may use Eq. 4/20, therefore, as the equation of motion of m, whether it is gaining or losing mass. A frequent error in the use of the force-momentum equation is to express the partial force sum (cid:6)F as ΣF (cid:2) d dt (mv) (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:3) m˙ v From this expansion we see that the direct differentiation of the linear momentum gives the correct force ΣF only when the body picks up mass initially at rest or when it expels mass which is left with zero absolute velocity. In both instances, v0 (cid:2) 0 and u (cid:2) v. Alternative Approach We may also obtain Eq. 4/20 by a direct differentiation of the mo- mentum from the basic relation ΣF (cid:2) provided a proper system of constant total mass is chosen. To illustrate this approach, we take the case where m is losing mass and use Fig. 4/6c, which shows the system of m and an arbitrary portion m0 of the stream of ejected mass. The mass of this system is m (cid:3) m0 and is constant. G˙, is a ﬁreﬁghting The Super Scooper airplane which can quickly ingest water from a lake by skimming across the surface with just a bottom-mounted scoop entering the water. The mass within the aircraft boundary varies during the scooping operation as well as during the dumping operation shown. The ejected stream of mass is assumed to move undisturbed once separated from m, and the only force external to the entire system is ΣF which is applied directly to m as before. The reaction R (cid:2) is inter- nal to the system and is not disclosed as an external force on the system. With constant total mass, the momentum principle ΣF (cid:2) is applicable and we have (cid:5)m˙ u G˙ ΣF (cid:2) d dt (mv (cid:3) m0v0) (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:3) m˙ v (cid:3) m˙ 0v0 (cid:3) m0v˙0 c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:34 PM Page 305 m˙ 0 Clearly, (cid:2) and the velocity of the ejected mass with respect to m is u (cid:2) v (cid:5) v0. Also (cid:2) 0 since m0 moves undisturbed with no ac- v˙0 celeration once free of m. Thus, the relation becomes (cid:5)m˙ , ΣF (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:3) m˙ u which is identical to the result of the previous formulation, Eq. 4/20. Application to Rocket Propulsion The case of m losing mass is clearly descriptive of rocket propulsion. Figure 4/7a shows a vertically ascending rocket, the system for which is the mass within the volume deﬁned by the exterior surface of the rocket and the exit plane across the nozzle. External to this system, the free- body diagram discloses the instantaneous values of gravitational attrac- tion mg, aerodynamic resistance R, and the force pA due to the average static pressure p across the nozzle exit plane of area A. The rate of mass ﬂow is m(cid:2) (cid:2) Thus, we may write the equation of motion of the rocket, ΣF (cid:2) m˙ u, mv˙ as pA (cid:5) mg (cid:5) R (cid:2) (cid:5)m˙ . (cid:3) mv˙ m˙ u, or (cid:3) Article 4/7 Variable Mass 305 R R m(cid:2)u (cid:3) pA (cid:5) mg (cid:5) R (cid:2) mv˙ (4/21) mg mg pA pA Actual system (a) T = m′u Simulated system (b) Figure 4/7 Equation 4/21 is of the form “ΣF (cid:2) ma” where the ﬁrst term in “ΣF” is the thrust T (cid:2) m(cid:2)u. Thus, the rocket may be simulated as a body to which an external thrust T is applied, Fig. 4/7b, and the problem may then be analyzed like any other F (cid:2) ma problem, except that m is a function of time. Observe that, during the initial stages of motion when the magni- tude of the velocity v of the rocket is less than the relative exhaust veloc- ity u, the absolute velocity v0 of the exhaust gases will be directed rearward. On the other hand, when the rocket reaches a velocity v whose magnitude is greater than u, the absolute velocity v0 of the exhaust gases will be directed forward. For a given mass rate of ﬂow, the rocket thrust T depends only on the relative exhaust velocity u and not on the magni- tude or on the direction of the absolute velocity v0 of the exhaust gases. In the foregoing treatment of bodies whose mass changes with time, we have assumed that all elements of the mass m of the body were mov- ing with the same velocity v at any instant of time and that the particles of mass added to or expelled from the body underwent an abrupt transi- tion of velocity upon entering or leaving the body. Thus, this velocity change has been modeled as a mathematical discontinuity. In reality, this change in velocity cannot be discontinuous even though the transi- tion may be rapid. In the case of a rocket, for example, the velocity change occurs continuously in the space between the combustion zone and the exit plane of the exhaust nozzle. A more general analysis* of variable-mass dynamics removes this restriction of discontinuous veloc- ity change and introduces a slight correction to Eq. 4/20. *For a development of the equations which describe the general motion of a time-dependent system of mass, see Art. 53 of the ﬁrst author’s Dynamics, 2nd Edition, SI Version, 1975, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:34 PM Page 306 306 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles SAMPLE PROBLEM 4/10 The end of a chain of length L and mass (cid:5) per unit length which is piled on a platform is lifted vertically with a constant velocity v by a variable force P. Find P as a function of the height x of the end above the platform. Also ﬁnd the en- ergy lost during the lifting of the chain. Solution I (Variable-Mass Approach). Equation 4/20 will be used and applied to the moving part of the chain of length x which is gaining mass. The force summation ΣF includes all forces acting on the moving part except the force exerted by the particles which are being attached. From the diagram we have ΣFx (cid:2) P (cid:5) (cid:5)gx The velocity is constant so that (cid:2) 0. The rate of increase of mass is (cid:2) (cid:5)v, and the relative velocity with which the attaching particles approach the moving part is u (cid:2) v (cid:5) 0 (cid:2) v. Thus, Eq. 4/20 becomes m˙ v˙ (cid:2) [ΣF (cid:2) mv˙ (cid:3) m˙ u] P (cid:5) (cid:5)gx (cid:2) 0 (cid:3) (cid:5)v(v) P (cid:2) (cid:5)(gx (cid:3) v2) Ans. We now see that the force P consists of the two parts, (cid:5)gx, which is the weight of the moving part of the chain, and (cid:5)v2, which is the added force required to change the momentum of the links on the platform from a condition at rest to a velocity v. Solution II (Constant-Mass Approach). The principle of impulse and momentum for a system of particles expressed by Eq. 4/6 will be applied to the entire chain considered as the system of constant mass. The free-body diagram of the system shows the unknown force P, the total weight of all links (cid:5)gL, and the force (cid:5)g(L (cid:5) x) exerted by the platform on those links which are at rest on it. The momentum of the system at any position is Gx (cid:2) (cid:5)xv and the momentum equation gives P x Helpful Hints (cid:2) The model of Fig. 4/6a shows the mass being added to the leading end of the moving part. With the chain the mass is added to the trailing end, but the effect is the same.

Again the force P is seen to be equal to the weight of the portion of the chain which is off the platform plus the added term which accounts for the time rate of increase of momentum of the chain. G˙ (cid:3) We must be very careful not to use ΣF (cid:2) for a system whose mass is changing. Thus, we have taken the total chain as the system since its mass is constant. Energy Loss. Each link on the platform acquires its velocity abruptly through an impact with the link above it, which lifts it off the platform. The succession of impacts gives rise to an energy loss (cid:4)E (negative work (cid:5)(cid:4)E) so that the work- (cid:4) energy equation becomes (cid:9) (cid:2) P dx (cid:5) (cid:4)E (cid:2) (cid:4)T (cid:3) (cid:4)Vg, where U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:9) P dx (cid:2) (cid:9) L 0 ( (cid:5)gx (cid:3) (cid:5)v2) dx (cid:2) 1 2 (cid:5)gL2 (cid:3) (cid:5)v2L (cid:4)T (cid:2) 1 2 (cid:5)Lv2 (cid:4)Vg (cid:2) (cid:5)gL L 2 (cid:2) 1 2 (cid:5)gL2 Substituting into the work-energy equation gives 1 2 (cid:5)gL2 (cid:3) (cid:5)v2L (cid:5) (cid:4)E (cid:2) 1 2 (cid:5)Lv2 (cid:3) 1 2 (cid:5)gL2 (cid:4)E (cid:2) 1 2 (cid:5)Lv2 Ans.

Deter- mine the force P required to elevate the end of the rope with a constant velocity v and determine the corresponding reaction R between the coil and the platform. (cid:2) Solution. The free-body diagram of the coil and moving portion of the rope is shown in the left-hand ﬁgure. Because of some resistance to bending and some lateral motion, the transition from rest to vertical velocity v will occur over an appreciable segment of the rope. Nevertheless, assume ﬁrst that all moving ele- ments have the same velocity so that Eq. 4/6 for the system gives (cid:3) (cid:6)ΣFx (cid:2) (cid:7) dGx dt P (cid:3) R (cid:5) (cid:5)gL (cid:2) d dt ((cid:5) xv) P (cid:3) R (cid:2) (cid:5)v2 (cid:3) (cid:5)gL We assume further that all elements of the coil of rope are at rest on the plat- form and transmit no force to the platform other than their weight, so that R (cid:2) (cid:5)g(L (cid:5) x). Substitution into the foregoing relation gives P (cid:3) (cid:5)g(L (cid:5) x) (cid:2) (cid:5)v2 (cid:3) (cid:5)gL or P (cid:2) (cid:5)v2 (cid:3) (cid:5)gx which is the same result as that for the chain in Sample Problem 4/10. The total work done on the rope by P becomes 1-2 (cid:2) (cid:9) P dx (cid:2) (cid:9) x U(cid:2) 0 ( (cid:5)v2 (cid:3) (cid:5)gx) dx (cid:2) (cid:5)v2x (cid:3) 1 2 (cid:5)gx2 Substitution into the work-energy equation gives [U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:2) (cid:4)T (cid:3) (cid:4)Vg] (cid:5)v2x (cid:3) 1 2 (cid:5)gx2 (cid:2) (cid:4)T (cid:3) (cid:5)gx x 2 (cid:4)T (cid:2) (cid:5) xv2 (cid:4) (cid:5) xv2 which is twice the kinetic energy of vertical motion. Thus, an equal amount of kinetic energy is unaccounted for. This conclusion largely negates our assumption of one-dimensional x-motion. 1 2 In order to produce a one-dimensional model which retains the inextensibility property assigned to the rope, it is necessary to impose a physical constraint at the base to guide the rope into vertical motion and at the same time preserve a smooth transition from rest to upward velocity v without energy loss. Such a guide is in- cluded in the free-body diagram of the entire rope in the middle ﬁgure and is rep- resented schematically in the middle free-body diagram of the right-hand ﬁgure. (cid:5) For a conservative system, the work-energy equation gives (cid:6) [dU(cid:2) (cid:2) dT (cid:3) dVg] P dx (cid:2) d(1 2 (cid:5) xv2) (cid:3) d(cid:3)(cid:5)gx (cid:4) x 2 P (cid:2) 1 2 (cid:5)v2 (cid:3) (cid:5)gx Substitution into the impulse-momentum equation ΣFx (cid:2) G˙ x gives 1 2 (cid:5)v2 (cid:3) (cid:5)gx (cid:3) R (cid:5) (cid:5)gL (cid:2) (cid:5)v2 R (cid:2) 1 Although this force, which exceeds the weight by tally, it would be present in the idealized model.

Such a system can form a rigid body, a nonrigid (elastic) solid body, or a group of separate and unconnected particles, such as those in a deﬁned mass of liquid or gaseous particles. The following summarizes the principal results of Chapter 4. 1. We derived the generalized form of Newton’s second law, which is expressed as the principle of motion of the mass center, Eq. 4/1 in Art. 4/2. This principle states that the vector sum of the external forces acting on any system of mass particles equals the total sys- tem mass times the acceleration of the center of mass. 2. In Art. 4/3, we established a work-energy principle for a system of particles, Eq. 4/3a, and showed that the total kinetic energy of the system equals the energy of the mass-center translation plus the en- ergy due to motion of the particles relative to the mass center. 3. The resultant of the external forces acting on any system equals the time rate of change of the linear momentum of the system, Eq. 4/6 in Art. 4/4. 4. For a ﬁxed point O and the mass center G, the resultant vector mo- ment of all external forces about the point equals the time rate of change of angular momentum about the point, Eq. 4/7 and Eq. 4/9 in Art. 4/4. The principle for an arbitrary point P, Eqs. 4/11 and 4/13, has an additional term and thus does not follow the form of the equations for O and G. 5. In Art. 4/5 we developed the law of conservation of dynamical en- ergy, which applies to a system in which the internal kinetic friction is negligible. 6. Conservation of linear momentum applies to a system in the absence of an external linear impulse. Similarly, conservation of angular mo- mentum applies when there is no external angular impulse. 7. For applications involving steady mass ﬂow, we developed a rela- tion, Eq. 4/18 in Art. 4/6, between the resultant force on a system, the corresponding mass ﬂow rate, and the change in ﬂuid velocity from entrance to exit. 8. Analysis of angular momentum in steady mass ﬂow resulted in Eq. 4/19a in Art. 4/6, which is a relation between the resultant moment of all external forces about a ﬁxed point O on or off the system, the mass ﬂow rate, and the incoming and outgoing velocities. 9. Finally, in Art. 4/7 we developed the equation of linear motion for variable-mass systems, Eq. 4/20. Common examples of such systems are rockets and ﬂexible chains and ropes. The principles developed in this chapter enable us to treat the mo- tion of both rigid and nonrigid bodies in a uniﬁed manner. In addition, the developments in Arts. 4/2–4/5 will serve to place on a rigorous basis the treatment of rigid-body kinetics in Chapters 6 and 7. c04.qxd 2/8/12 7:34 PM Page 316 316 Chapter 4 Kinetics of Systems of Particles REVIEW PROBLEMS 4/93 Each of the identical steel balls weighs 4 lb and is fastened to the other two by connecting bars of neg- ligible weight and unequal length.

The designs of gears, cams, connecting links, and many other moving machine parts are largely kinematic problems. R.

In rigid-body kinematics we use these same relationships but must also account for the rotational mo- tion of the body. Thus rigid-body kinematics involves both linear and angular displacements, velocities, and accelerations. We need to describe the motion of rigid bodies for two important reasons. First, we frequently need to generate, transmit, or control cer- tain motions by the use of cams, gears, and linkages of various types. Here we must analyze the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the motion to determine the design geometry of the mechanical parts. Furthermore, as a result of the motion generated, forces may be devel- oped which must be accounted for in the design of the parts. Second, we must often determine the motion of a rigid body caused by the forces applied to it. Calculation of the motion of a rocket under the inﬂuence of its thrust and gravitational attraction is an example of such a problem. We need to apply the principles of rigid-body kinematics in both sit- uations. This chapter covers the kinematics of rigid-body motion which may be analyzed as occurring in a single plane. In Chapter 7 we will pre- sent an introduction to the kinematics of motion in three dimensions. 5 325 c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 326 326 Chapter 5 Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies Rigid-Body Assumption In the previous chapter we deﬁned a rigid body as a system of parti- cles for which the distances between the particles remain unchanged. Thus, if each particle of such a body is located by a position vector from reference axes attached to and rotating with the body, there will be no change in any position vector as measured from these axes. This is, of course, an ideal case since all solid materials change shape to some ex- tent when forces are applied to them. Nevertheless, if the movements associated with the changes in shape are very small compared with the movements of the body as a whole, then the assumption of rigidity is usually acceptable. The dis- placements due to the ﬂutter of an aircraft wing, for instance, do not af- fect the description of the ﬂight path of the aircraft as a whole, and thus the rigid-body assumption is clearly acceptable. On the other hand, if the problem is one of describing, as a function of time, the internal wing stress due to wing ﬂutter, then the relative motions of portions of the wing cannot be neglected, and the wing may not be considered a rigid body. In this and the next two chapters, almost all of the material is based on the assumption of rigidity. Plane Motion A rigid body executes plane motion when all parts of the body move in parallel planes. For convenience, we generally consider the plane of motion to be the plane which contains the mass center, and we treat the body as a thin slab whose motion is conﬁned to the plane of the slab. This idealization adequately describes a very large category of rigid- body motions encountered in engineering. The plane motion of a rigid body may be divided into several cate- gories, as represented in Fig. 5/1. Translation is deﬁned as any motion in which every line in the body remains parallel to its original position at all times. In translation there is no rotation of any line in the body. In rectilinear translation, part a of Fig. 5/1, all points in the body move in parallel straight lines. In curvilinear translation, part b, all points move on congruent curves. We note that in each of the two cases of translation, the motion of the body is completely speciﬁed by the motion of any point in the body, since all points have the same motion. Thus, our earlier study of the motion of a point (particle) in Chapter 2 enables us to describe completely the translation of a rigid body. Rotation about a ﬁxed axis, part c of Fig. 5/1, is the angular motion about the axis. It follows that all particles in a rigid body move in circu- lar paths about the axis of rotation, and all lines in the body which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation (including those which do not pass through the axis) rotate through the same angle in the same time. Again, our discussion in Chapter 2 on the circular motion of a point en- ables us to describe the motion of a rotating rigid body, which is treated in the next article. General plane motion of a rigid body, part d of Fig. 5/1, is a com- bination of translation and rotation. We will utilize the principles of rel- ative motion covered in Art. 2/8 to describe general plane motion. These nickel microgears are only 150 microns (150(10(cid:2)6) m) thick and have potential application in microscopic robots. . c n I r , s r e h c a e s e R o t o h P / r e k r a P d v a D i c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 327 Type of Rigid-Body Plane Motion Example Article 5/2 Rotation 327 A A B B A′ A′ B′ B′ A θ B B′ A A′ (a) Rectilinear translation (b) Curvilinear translation (c) Fixed-axis rotation (d) General plane motion Rocket test sled Parallel-link swinging plate Compound pendulum B B′ Connecting rod in a reciprocating engine Figure 5/1 Note that in each of the examples cited, the actual paths of all parti- cles in the body are projected onto the single plane of motion as repre- sented in each ﬁgure. Analysis of the plane motion of rigid bodies is accomplished either by directly calculating the absolute displacements and their time deriva- tives from the geometry involved or by utilizing the principles of relative motion. Each method is important and useful and will be covered in turn in the articles which follow. 5/2 Rotation The rotation of a rigid body is described by its angular motion. Figure 5/2 shows a rigid body which is rotating as it undergoes plane motion in the plane of the figure. The angular positions of any two lines 1 and 2 attached to the body are specified by (cid:2)1 and (cid:2)2 measured from any convenient fixed reference direction. Because the angle (cid:3) is invariant, the relation (cid:2)2 (cid:2) (cid:2)1 (cid:3) (cid:3) upon differentiation with respect or, during a ﬁnite interval, (cid:4)(cid:2)2 (cid:2) (cid:4)(cid:2)1. to time gives (cid:2) Thus, all lines on a rigid body in its plane of motion have the same an- gular displacement, the same angular velocity, and the same angular acceleration.

Angular motion does not require the presence of a ﬁxed axis, normal to the plane of motion, about which the line and the body rotate. KEY CONCEPTS Angular-Motion Relations The angular velocity (cid:4) and angular acceleration (cid:5) of a rigid body in plane rotation are, respectively, the ﬁrst and second time derivatives of the angular position coordinate (cid:2) of any line in the plane of motion of the body. These deﬁnitions give (cid:4) (cid:2) d(cid:2) dt (cid:2) (cid:2)˙ (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)˙ d(cid:4) dt (cid:4) d(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5) d(cid:2) or or (cid:2) (cid:2)¨ (cid:5) (cid:2) d2(cid:2) dt2 (cid:2)˙ d (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) (cid:2)¨ d(cid:2) (5/1) The third relation is obtained by eliminating dt from the ﬁrst two. In each of these relations, the positive direction for (cid:4) and (cid:5), clockwise or counterclockwise, is the same as that chosen for (cid:2). Equations 5/1 should be recognized as analogous to the deﬁning equations for the rectilinear motion of a particle, expressed by Eqs. 2/1, 2/2, and 2/3. In fact, all rela- tions which were described for rectilinear motion in Art. 2/2 apply to the case of rotation in a plane if the linear quantities s, v, and a are replaced by their respective equivalent angular quantities (cid:2), (cid:4), and (cid:5). As we pro- ceed further with rigid-body dynamics, we will ﬁnd that the analogies between the relationships for linear and angular motion are almost complete throughout kinematics and kinetics. These relations are im- portant to recognize, as they help to demonstrate the symmetry and unity found throughout mechanics. For rotation with constant angular acceleration, the integrals of Eqs. 5/1 becomes (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:4)2 (cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 (cid:3) (cid:5)t 2 (cid:3) 2(cid:5)((cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:2) 0) 0 0t (cid:3) 1 (cid:5)t2 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) 2 Here (cid:2)0 and (cid:4)0 are the values of the angular position coordinate and an- gular velocity, respectively, at t (cid:2) 0, and t is the duration of the motion considered. You should be able to carry out these integrations easily, as they are completely analogous to the corresponding equations for recti- linear motion with constant acceleration covered in Art. 2/2. The graphical relationships described for s, v, a, and t in Figs. 2/3 and 2/4 may be used for (cid:2), (cid:4), and (cid:5) merely by substituting the corre- sponding symbols. You should sketch these graphical relations for plane c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 329 rotation. The mathematical procedures for obtaining rectilinear velocity and displacement from rectilinear acceleration may be applied to rota- tion by merely replacing the linear quantities by their corresponding an- gular quantities. Rotation about a Fixed Axis When a rigid body rotates about a ﬁxed axis, all points other than those on the axis move in concentric circles about the ﬁxed axis. Thus, for the rigid body in Fig. 5/3 rotating about a ﬁxed axis normal to the plane of the ﬁgure through O, any point such as A moves in a circle of radius r. From the previous discussion in Art. 2/5, you should already be familiar with the relationships between the linear motion of A and the angular motion of the line normal to its path, which is also the angular motion of the rigid body. With the notation (cid:4) (cid:2) and (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:2) for the angular velocity and angular acceleration, respectively, of the body we have Eqs. 2/11, rewritten as (cid:4)˙ (cid:2)¨ (cid:2)˙ Article 5/2 Rotation 329 t v = rω at = rα A an = r 2ω α ω n r O v (cid:2) r(cid:4) an (cid:2) r(cid:4)2 (cid:2) v2/r (cid:2) v(cid:4) at (cid:2) r(cid:5) (5/2) Figure 5/3 These quantities may be expressed alternatively using the cross-prod- uct relationship of vector notation. The vector formulation is especially important in the analysis of three-dimensional motion. The angular veloc- ity of the rotating body may be expressed by the vector (cid:2) normal to the plane of rotation and having a sense governed by the right-hand rule, as shown in Fig. 5/4a. From the deﬁnition of the vector cross product, we see that the vector v is obtained by crossing (cid:2) into r. This cross product gives the correct magnitude and direction for v and we write v (cid:2) r˙ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) r The order of the vectors to be crossed must be retained.

The torque pro- duces a counterclockwise angular acceleration (cid:5) (cid:2) 4t rad/s2, where t is the time in seconds during which the torque is applied. Determine (a) the time required for the ﬂywheel to reduce its clockwise angular speed to 900 rev/min, (b) the time required for the ﬂywheel to reverse its direction of rotation, and (c) the total number of revolutions, clockwise plus counterclockwise, turned by the ﬂywheel during the ﬁrst 14 seconds of torque application. Solution. The counterclockwise direction will be taken arbitrarily as positive. (a) Since (cid:5) is a known function of the time, we may integrate it to obtain angular velocity. With the initial angular velocity of (cid:5)1800(2(cid:6))/60 (cid:2) (cid:5)60(cid:6) rad/s, we have (cid:2) [d(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5) dt] (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5)60(cid:6) d(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3) t 4t dt 0 (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5)60(cid:6) (cid:3) 2t2 Substituting the clockwise angular speed of 900 rev/min or (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:5)900(2(cid:6))/60 (cid:2) (cid:5)30(cid:6) rad/s gives (cid:5)30(cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:5)60(cid:6) (cid:3) 2t2 t2 (cid:2) 15(cid:6) t (cid:2) 6.86 s Ans.

As the load passes this position, compute (a) the acceleration of point C on the cable in con- tact with the drum and (b) the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the pinion A. Solution.

In this approach, we make use of the geometric relations which deﬁne the conﬁguration of the body involved and then proceed to take the time derivatives of the deﬁning geometric relations to obtain velocities and accelerations. In Art. 2/9 of Chapter 2 on particle kinematics, we introduced the application of absolute-motion analysis for the constrained motion of connected particles. For the pulley conﬁgurations treated, the relevant velocities and accelerations were determined by successive differentia- tion of the lengths of the connecting cables. In this earlier treatment, the geometric relations were quite simple, and no angular quantities had to be considered. Now that we will be dealing with rigid-body mo- tion, however, we ﬁnd that our deﬁning geometric relations include both linear and angular variables and, therefore, the time derivatives of these quantities will involve both linear and angular velocities and linear and angular accelerations. s e g a m I y t t e G / e n o t S / n o s r e h p c a M m i T In absolute-motion analysis, it is essential that we be consistent with the mathematics of the description. For example, if the angular po- sition of a moving line in the plane of motion is speciﬁed by its counter- clockwise angle (cid:2) measured from some convenient ﬁxed reference axis, then the positive sense for both angular velocity and angular acceler- ation will also be counterclockwise. A negative sign for either quantity will, of course, indicate a clockwise angular motion. The deﬁning rela- tions for linear motion, Eqs. 2/1, 2/2, and 2/3, and the relations involving angular motion, Eqs. 5/1 and 5/2 or 5/3, will ﬁnd repeated use in the mo- tion analysis and should be mastered. (cid:2)¨ (cid:2)˙ Ski-lift pulley tower near the Matter- horn in Switzerland. The absolute-motion approach to rigid-body kinematics is quite straightforward, provided the conﬁguration lends itself to a geometric description which is not overly complex. If the geometric conﬁguration is awkward or complex, analysis by the principles of relative motion may be preferable. Relative-motion analysis is treated in this chapter beginning with Art. 5/4. The choice between absolute- and relative-motion analyses is best made after experience has been gained with both approaches. The next three sample problems illustrate the application of absolute- motion analysis to three commonly encountered situations. The kine- matics of a rolling wheel, treated in Sample Problem 5/4, is especially important and will be useful in much of the problem work because the rolling wheel in various forms is such a common element in mechanical systems. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 339 SAMPLE PROBLEM 5/4 A wheel of radius r rolls on a ﬂat surface without slipping. Determine the angular motion of the wheel in terms of the linear motion of its center O. Also determine the acceleration of a point on the rim of the wheel as the point comes into contact with the surface on which the wheel rolls. Solution. The ﬁgure shows the wheel rolling to the right from the dashed to the full position without slipping. The linear displacement of the center O is s, which is also the arc length C(cid:2)A along the rim on which the wheel rolls. The ra- dial line CO rotates to the new position C(cid:2)O(cid:2) through the angle (cid:2), where (cid:2) is measured from the vertical direction. If the wheel does not slip, the arc C(cid:2)A must equal the distance s. Thus, the displacement relationship and its two time deriv- atives give (cid:2) s (cid:2) r(cid:2) vO (cid:2) r(cid:4) aO (cid:2) r(cid:5) Ans. s˙, v˙O (cid:2)¨. (cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:2) and (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:2) The angle (cid:2), of course, must where vO (cid:2) aO (cid:2) be in radians. The acceleration aO will be directed in the sense opposite to that of vO if the wheel is slowing down. In this event, the angular acceleration (cid:5) will have the sense opposite to that of (cid:4). (cid:2)˙, s¨, (cid:4)˙ The origin of ﬁxed coordinates is taken arbitrarily but conveniently at the point of contact between C on the rim of the wheel and the ground. When point C has moved along its cycloidal path to C(cid:2), its new coordinates and their time de- rivatives become x (cid:2) s (cid:5) r sin (cid:2) (cid:2) r((cid:2) (cid:5) sin (cid:2)) y (cid:2) r (cid:5) r cos (cid:2) (cid:2) r(1 (cid:5) cos (cid:2)) x˙ (cid:2) r (cid:2)˙(1 (cid:5) cos (cid:2)) (cid:2) vO(1 (cid:5) cos (cid:2)) x¨ (cid:2) v˙O(1 (cid:5) cos (cid:2)) (cid:3) vO (cid:2)˙ sin (cid:2) y˙ (cid:2) r (cid:2)˙ sin (cid:2) (cid:2) vO sin (cid:2) y¨ (cid:2) v˙O sin (cid:2) (cid:3) vO (cid:2)˙ cos (cid:2) (cid:2) aO(1 (cid:5) cos (cid:2)) (cid:3) r(cid:4)2 sin (cid:2) (cid:2) aO sin (cid:2) (cid:3) r(cid:4)2 cos (cid:2) For the desired instant of contact, (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 and (cid:3) x¨ (cid:2) 0 and y¨ (cid:2) r(cid:4)2 Ans. Thus, the acceleration of the point C on the rim at the instant of contact with the ground depends only on r and (cid:4) and is directed toward the center of the wheel. If desired, the velocity and acceleration of C at any position (cid:2) may be ob- tained by writing the expressions v (cid:2) (cid:3) and a (cid:2) (cid:3) x˙i y¨j. x¨i y˙j Application of the kinematic relationships for a wheel which rolls without slipping should be recognized for various conﬁgurations of rolling wheels such as those illustrated on the right.

In Art. 2/8 we developed these principles for motion relative to translating axes and applied the relative-velocity equation vA (cid:2) vB (cid:3) vA/B [2/20] to the motions of two particles A and B. Relative Velocity Due to Rotation We now choose two points on the same rigid body for our two parti- cles. The consequence of this choice is that the motion of one point as seen by an observer translating with the other point must be circular since the radial distance to the observed point from the reference point does not change. This observation is the key to the successful under- standing of a large majority of problems in the plane motion of rigid bodies. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 5/5a, which shows a rigid body moving in the plane of the ﬁgure from position AB to A(cid:2)B(cid:2) during time (cid:4)t. This movement may be visualized as occurring in two parts. First, the body translates to the parallel position A(cid:3)B(cid:2) with the displacement (cid:4)rB. Second, the body rotates about B(cid:2) through the angle (cid:4)(cid:2). From the nonrotating reference axes x(cid:2)-y(cid:2) attached to the reference point B(cid:2), you can see that this remaining motion of the body is one of simple rotation about B(cid:2), giving rise to the displacement (cid:4)rA/B of A with respect to B. To the nonrotating observer attached to B, the body appears to undergo ﬁxed-axis rotation about B with A executing circular motion as empha- sized in Fig. 5/5b. Therefore, the relationships developed for circular motion in Arts. 2/5 and 5/2 and cited as Eqs. 2/11 and 5/2 (or 5/3) de- scribe the relative portion of the motion of point A. Point B was arbitrarily chosen as the reference point for attachment of our nonrotating reference axes x-y. Point A could have been used just as well, in which case we would observe B to have circular motion about A considered ﬁxed as shown in Fig. 5/5c. We see that the sense of the y′ Y Δ rB B′ y B A′ rA / B A″ Δ rB Δ rA A r Δ θ x′ r x B X (a) Motion relative to B (b) Figure 5/5 A′ A rA / B Δ θ r A r Δ θ B rB / A B′ Motion relative to A (c) Δ Δ Δ c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 349 Article 5/4 Relative Velocity 349 rotation, counterclockwise in this example, is the same whether we choose A or B as the reference, and we see that (cid:4)rB/A (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:4)rA/B. With B as the reference point, we see from Fig. 5/5a that the total displacement of A is (cid:4)rA (cid:2) (cid:4)rB (cid:3) (cid:4)rA/B where (cid:4)rA/B has the magnitude r(cid:4)(cid:2) as (cid:4)(cid:2) approaches zero. We note that the relative linear motion (cid:4)rA/B is accompanied by the absolute angular motion (cid:4)(cid:2), as seen from the translating axes x(cid:2)-y(cid:2). Dividing the expres- sion for (cid:4)rA by the corresponding time interval (cid:4)t and passing to the limit, we obtain the relative-velocity equation vA (cid:2) vB (cid:3) vA/B (5/4) This expression is the same as Eq. 2/20, with the one restriction that the distance r between A and B remains constant. The magnitude of the rel- (r(cid:4)(cid:2)/(cid:4)t) ative velocity is thus seen to be vA/B (cid:2) which, with (cid:4) (cid:2) becomes ((cid:2)(cid:4)rA/B(cid:2)/(cid:4)t) (cid:2) lim (cid:4)tl0 lim (cid:4)tl0 (cid:2)˙, vA/B (cid:2) r(cid:4) (5/5) Using r to represent the vector rA/B from the ﬁrst of Eqs. 5/3, we may write the relative velocity as the vector vA/B (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) r (5/6) where (cid:2) is the angular-velocity vector normal to the plane of the motion in the sense determined by the right-hand rule. A critical observation seen from Figs. 5/5b and c is that the relative linear velocity is always perpendicular to the line joining the two points in question. Interpretation of the Relative-Velocity Equation We can better understand the application of Eq. 5/4 by visualizing the separate translation and rotation components of the equation. These components are emphasized in Fig. 5/6, which shows a rigid body vA vB r B A = Path of A Path of B vA / B vB A vB B + ω r B A vA / B vA vB Figure 5/6 c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 350 350 Chapter 5 Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies in plane motion. With B chosen as the reference point, the velocity of A is the vector sum of the translational portion vB, plus the rotational por- (cid:2)˙, tion vA/B (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) r, which has the magnitude vA/B (cid:2) r(cid:4), where (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2) the absolute angular velocity of AB. The fact that the relative linear ve- locity is always perpendicular to the line joining the two points in ques- tion is an important key to the solution of many problems. To reinforce your understanding of this concept, you should draw the equivalent dia- gram where point A is used as the reference point rather than B. Equation 5/4 may also be used to analyze constrained sliding con- tact between two links in a mechanism. In this case, we choose points A and B as coincident points, one on each link, for the instant under con- sideration. In contrast to the previous example, in this case, the two points are on different bodies so they are not a ﬁxed distance apart. This second use of the relative-velocity equation is illustrated in Sample Problem 5/10. Solution of the Relative-Velocity Equation Solution of the relative-velocity equation may be carried out by scalar or vector algebra, or a graphical analysis may be employed. A sketch of the vector polygon which represents the vector equation should always be made to reveal the physical relationships involved. From this sketch, you can write scalar component equations by project- ing the vectors along convenient directions. You can usually avoid solv- ing simultaneous equations by a careful choice of the projections. Alternatively, each term in the relative-motion equation may be written in terms of its i- and j-components, from which you will obtain two scalar equations when the equality is applied, separately, to the coefﬁ- cients of the i- and j-terms. Many problems lend themselves to a graphical solution, particularly when the given geometry results in an awkward mathematical expres- sion. In this case, we ﬁrst construct the known vectors in their correct positions using a convenient scale. Then we construct the unknown vec- tors which complete the polygon and satisfy the vector equation. Fi- nally, we measure the unknown vectors directly from the drawing. The choice of method to be used depends on the particular problem at hand, the accuracy required, and individual preference and experi- ence. All three approaches are illustrated in the sample problems which follow. Regardless of which method of solution we employ, we note that the single vector equation in two dimensions is equivalent to two scalar equations, so that at most two scalar unknowns can be determined. The unknowns, for instance, might be the magnitude of one vector and the direction of another. We should make a systematic identiﬁcation of the knowns and unknowns before attempting a solution. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 351 SAMPLE PROBLEM 5/7 The wheel of radius r (cid:2) 300 mm rolls to the right without slipping and has a velocity vO (cid:2) 3 m/s of its center O.

(cid:3) The vectors may also be laid off to scale graphically and the magnitude and direction of vA measured di- rectly from the diagram. (cid:4) The velocity of any point on the wheel is easily determined by using the contact point C as the reference point. You should construct the ve- locity vectors for a number of points on the wheel for practice. (cid:5) The vector (cid:2) is directed into the paper by the right-hand rule, whereas the positive z-direction is out from the paper; hence, the minus sign. Solution I (Scalar-Geometric). The center O is chosen as the reference point for the relative-velocity equation since its motion is given. We therefore write vA (cid:2) vO (cid:3) vA/O where the relative-velocity term is observed from the translating axes x-y at- tached to O. The angular velocity of AO is the same as that of the wheel which, from Sample Problem 5/4, is (cid:4) (cid:2) vO/r (cid:2) 3/0.3 (cid:2) 10 rad/s. Thus, from Eq. 5/5 we have [vA/O (cid:2) r0 (cid:2)˙] vA/O (cid:2) 0.2(10) (cid:2) 2 m/s which is normal to AO as shown.

Solution II (Scalar-Geometric). Solution by the scalar geometry of the vec- tor triangle is particularly simple here since vA and vB are at right angles for this special position of the linkages. First, we compute vB, which is [v (cid:2) r(cid:4)] vB (cid:2) 0.075(2) (cid:2) 0.150 m/s and represent it in its correct direction as shown. The vector vA/B must be per- pendicular to AB, and the angle (cid:2) between vA/B and vB is also the angle made by AB with the horizontal direction.

If the crank OB has a clockwise rotational speed of 1500 rev/min, determine for the position where (cid:2) (cid:2) 60(cid:2) the velocity of the piston A, the velocity of point G on the connecting rod, and the angular velocity of the connecting rod. Solution. The velocity of the crank pin B as a point on AB is easily found, so that B will be used as the reference point for determining the velocity of A. The relative-velocity equation may now be written vA (cid:2) vB (cid:3) vA/B The crank-pin velocity is (cid:2) [v (cid:2) r(cid:4)] vB (cid:2) 5 12 1500 (2(cid:6)) 60 (cid:2) 65.4 ft/sec and is normal to OB. The direction of vA is, of course, along the horizontal cylin- der axis. The direction of vA/B must be perpendicular to the line AB as explained in the present article and as indicated in the lower diagram, where the reference point B is shown as ﬁxed. We obtain this direction by computing angle (cid:3) from the law of sines, which gives 5 sin (cid:3) (cid:2) 14 sin 60(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) sin(cid:5)1 0.309 (cid:2) 18.02(cid:2) We now complete the sketch of the velocity triangle, where the angle between vA/B and vA is 90(cid:2) (cid:5) 18.02(cid:2) (cid:2) 72.0(cid:2) and the third angle is 180(cid:2) (cid:5) 30(cid:2) (cid:5) 72.0(cid:2) (cid:2) 78.0(cid:2). Vectors vA and vA/B are shown with their proper sense such that the head-to-tail sum of vB and vA/B equals vA. The magnitudes of the unknowns are now calculated from the trigonometry of the vector triangle or are scaled from the diagram if a graphical solution is used.

If we use B as our reference point and write vA (cid:2) vB (cid:3) vA/B, we see from the diagram, which shows the arm and points A and B an instant before and an instant after coincidence, that vA/B has a direction along the slot away from O. The magnitudes of vA and vA/B are the only unknowns in the vector equa- tion, so that it may now be solved.

We now solve the problem by choosing a unique reference point which momentarily has zero velocity. As far as velocities are concerned, the body may be considered to be in pure rotation about an axis, normal to the plane of motion, passing through this point. This axis is called the instantaneous axis of zero velocity, and the intersection of this axis with the plane of motion is known as the instantaneous center of zero velocity. This approach provides us with a valuable means for visualizing and an- alyzing velocities in plane motion. Locating the Instantaneous Center The existence of the instantaneous center is easily shown. For the body in Fig. 5/7, assume that the directions of the absolute velocities of any two points A and B on the body are known and are not parallel. If there is a point about which A has absolute circular motion at the in- stant considered, this point must lie on the normal to vA through A. Similar reasoning applies to B, and the intersection of the two perpen- diculars fulﬁlls the requirement for an absolute center of rotation at the instant considered. Point C is the instantaneous center of zero velocity and may lie on or off the body. If it lies off the body, it may be visualized as lying on an imaginary extension of the body. The instantaneous cen- ter need not be a ﬁxed point in the body or a ﬁxed point in the plane. If we also know the magnitude of the velocity of one of the points, say, vA, we may easily obtain the angular velocity (cid:4) of the body and the linear velocity of every point in the body. Thus, the angular velocity of the body, Fig. 5/7a, is (cid:4) (cid:2) vA rA which, of course, is also the angular velocity of every line in the body. Therefore, the velocity of B is vB (cid:2) rB(cid:4) (cid:2) (rB/rA)vA. Once the instanta- neous center is located, the direction of the instantaneous velocity of A vA B vB rA C rB (a) A B vA vB C (b) Figure 5/7 vA A C B vB (c) c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:07 AM Page 363 Article 5/5 Instantaneous Center of Zero Velocity 363 every point in the body is readily found since it must be perpendicular to the radial line joining the point in question with C. If the velocities of two points in a body having plane motion are par- allel, Fig. 5/7b or 5/7c, and the line joining the points is perpendicular to the direction of the velocities, the instantaneous center is located by di- rect proportion as shown. We can readily see from Fig. 5/7b that as the parallel velocities become equal in magnitude, the instantaneous center moves farther away from the body and approaches inﬁnity in the limit as the body stops rotating and translates only. Motion of the Instantaneous Center As the body changes its position, the instantaneous center C also changes its position both in space and on the body. The locus of the in- stantaneous centers in space is known as the space centrode, and the locus of the positions of the instantaneous centers on the body is known as the body centrode. At the instant considered, the two curves are tan- gent at the position of point C. It can be shown that the body-centrode curve rolls on the space-centrode curve during the motion of the body, as indicated schematically in Fig. 5/8. Although the instantaneous center of zero velocity is momentarily at rest, its acceleration generally is not zero. Thus, this point may not be used as an instantaneous center of zero acceleration in a manner analo- gous to its use for ﬁnding velocity. An instantaneous center of zero ac- celeration does exist for bodies in general plane motion, but its location and use represent a specialized topic in mechanism kinematics and will not be treated here.

By differentiating the equation with respect to time, we or may obtain the relative-acceleration equation, which is v˙A (cid:2) v˙B (cid:3) v˙A/B aA (cid:2) aB (cid:3) aA/B (5/7) In words, Eq. 5/7 states that the acceleration of point A equals the vec- tor sum of the acceleration of point B and the acceleration which A ap- pears to have to a nonrotating observer moving with B. Relative Acceleration Due to Rotation If points A and B are located on the same rigid body and in the plane of motion, the distance r between them remains constant so that the observer moving with B perceives A to have circular motion about B, as we saw in Art. 5/4 with the relative-velocity relationship. Because the relative motion is circular, it follows that the relative-acceleration term will have both a normal component directed from A toward B due to the change of direction of vA/B and a tangential component perpendicular to AB due to the change in magnitude of vA/B. These acceleration compo- nents for circular motion, cited in Eqs. 5/2, were covered earlier in Art. 2/5 and should be thoroughly familiar by now. Thus we may write aA (cid:2) aB (cid:3) (aA/B)n (cid:3) (aA/B)t where the magnitudes of the relative-acceleration components are 2/r (cid:2) r(cid:4)2 (aA/B)n (cid:2) vA/B (aA/B)t (cid:2) v˙A/B (cid:2) r(cid:5) In vector notation the acceleration components are (5/8) (5/9) aA B aB Path of B A r = Path of A t aA/B nω α B + (aA/B)t A (aA/B)n aB A B aB (aA/B)n (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r) (aA/B)t (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) r (5/9a) In these relationships, (cid:2) is the angular velocity and (cid:3) is the angular ac- celeration of the body. The vector locating A from B is r. It is important to observe that the relative acceleration terms depend on the respective absolute angular velocity and absolute angular acceleration. aA/B (aA/B)t aA aB (aA/B)n Figure 5/9 Interpretation of the Relative-Acceleration Equation The meaning of Eqs. 5/8 and 5/9 is illustrated in Fig. 5/9, which shows a rigid body in plane motion with points A and B moving along separate curved paths with absolute accelerations aA and aB. Con- trary to the case with velocities, the accelerations aA and aB are, in general, not tangent to the paths described by A and B when these c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 373 Article 5/6 Relative Acceleration 373 paths are curvilinear. The figure shows the acceleration of A to be composed of two parts: the acceleration of B and the acceleration of A with respect to B. A sketch showing the reference point as fixed is useful in disclosing the correct sense of each of the two components of the relative-acceleration term. Alternatively, we may express the acceleration of B in terms of the acceleration of A, which puts the nonrotating reference axes on A rather than B. This order gives aB (cid:2) aA (cid:3) aB/A Here aB/A and its n- and t-components are the negatives of aA/B and its n- and t-components. To understand this analysis better, you should make a sketch corresponding to Fig. 5/9 for this choice of terms. Solution of the Relative-Acceleration Equation As in the case of the relative-velocity equation, we can handle the solution to Eq. 5/8 in three different ways, namely, by scalar algebra and geometry, by vector algebra, or by graphical construction. It is helpful to be familiar with all three techniques. You should make a sketch of the vector polygon representing the vector equation and pay close attention to the head-to-tail combination of vectors so that it agrees with the equation. Known vectors should be added ﬁrst, and the unknown vec- tors will become the closing legs of the vector polygon. It is vital that you visualize the vectors in their geometrical sense, as only then can you understand the full signiﬁcance of the acceleration equation. Before attempting a solution, identify the knowns and unknowns, keeping in mind that a solution to a vector equation in two dimensions can be carried out when the unknowns have been reduced to two scalar quantities. These quantities may be the magnitude or direction of any of the terms of the equation. When both points move on curved paths, there will, in general, be six scalar quantities to account for in Eq. 5/8. Because the normal acceleration components depend on velocities, it is generally necessary to solve for the velocities before the acceleration calcu- lations can be made. Choose the reference point in the relative-acceleration equation as some point on the body in question whose acceleration is ei- ther known or can be easily found. Be careful not to use the instantaneous center of zero velocity as the reference point unless its acceleration is known and accounted for. An instantaneous center of zero acceleration exists for a rigid body in general plane motion, but will not be discussed here since its use is somewhat specialized. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 374 374 Chapter 5 Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies SAMPLE PROBLEM 5/13 The wheel of radius r rolls to the left without slipping and, at the instant con- sidered, the center O has a velocity vO and an acceleration aO to the left. Deter- mine the acceleration of points A and C on the wheel for the instant considered. ω α aO vO A r0 θ O Solution. From our previous analysis of Sample Problem 5/4, we know that the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the wheel are (cid:4) (cid:2) vO/r and (cid:5) (cid:2) aO/r The acceleration of A is written in terms of the given acceleration of O. Thus, aA (cid:2) aO (cid:3) aA/O (cid:2) aO (cid:3) (aA/O)n (cid:3) (aA/O)t The relative-acceleration terms are viewed as though O were ﬁxed, and for this relative circular motion they have the magnitudes (aA/O)n (cid:2) r0 (aA/O)t (cid:2) r0 (cid:4)2 (cid:2) r0 (cid:5)vO r (cid:6)2 (cid:5) (cid:2) r0 (cid:5)aO r (cid:6) (cid:2) and the directions shown. Adding the vectors head-to-tail gives aA as shown. In a numerical problem, we may obtain the combination algebraically or graphically. The algebraic ex- pression for the magnitude of aA is found from the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. If we use n- and t-directions, we have (cid:3) aA (cid:2) (cid:4)(aA)n 2 (cid:3) (aA)t 2 t (aA/O)t n r C n θ O aA t (aA/O)t = r0 α A (aA/O)n = r0 ω 2 aO θ (aA/O)n O n (aC/O)n = rω 2 t α (aC/O)t = r C (aC/O)t = r α (cid:2) (cid:4)[aO cos (cid:2) (cid:3) (aA/O)n]2 (cid:3) [aO sin (cid:2) (cid:3) (aA/O)t]2 (cid:2) (cid:4)(r(cid:5) cos (cid:2) (cid:3) r0 (cid:4)2)2 (cid:3) (r(cid:5) sin (cid:2) (cid:3) r0 (cid:5))2 Ans. (aC/O)n = rω 2 aC = rω 2 The direction of aA can be computed if desired. The acceleration of the instantaneous center C of zero velocity, considered a point on the wheel, is obtained from the expression aC (cid:2) aO (cid:3) aC/O where the components of the relative-acceleration term are (aC/O)n (cid:2) r(cid:4)2 di- rected from C to O and (aC/O)t (cid:2) r(cid:5) directed to the right because of the counter- clockwise angular acceleration of line CO about O. The terms are added together in the lower diagram and it is seen that (cid:4) aC (cid:2) r(cid:4)2 Ans. aO = r α Helpful Hints (cid:2) The counterclockwise angular accel- eration (cid:5) of OA determines the posi- tive direction of (aA/O)t. The normal component (aA/O)n is, of course, di- rected toward the reference center O. (cid:3) If the wheel were rolling to the right with the same velocity vO but still had an acceleration aO to the left, note that the solution for aA would be unchanged. (cid:4) We note that the acceleration of the instantaneous center of zero veloc- ity is independent of (cid:5) and is di- rected toward the center of the wheel. This conclusion is a useful re- sult to remember. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 375 Article 5/6 Relative Acceleration 375 y A 100 mm rA O x C 75 mm rB ω CB rA/B 50 mm B 250 mm Helpful Hints (cid:2) Remember to preserve the order of the factors in the cross products. (cid:3) In expressing the term aA/B be cer- tain that rA/B is written as the vector from B to A and not the reverse. (cid:2) (cid:3) SAMPLE PROBLEM 5/14 The linkage of Sample Problem 5/8 is repeated here. Crank CB has a con- stant counterclockwise angular velocity of 2 rad/s in the position shown during a short interval of its motion. Determine the angular acceleration of links AB and OA for this position. Solve by using vector algebra. Solution. We ﬁrst solve for the velocities which were obtained in Sample Problem 5/8. They are (cid:4) AB (cid:2) (cid:5)6/7 rad/s and (cid:4) OA (cid:2) (cid:5)3/7 rad/s where the counterclockwise direction ((cid:3)k-direction) is taken as positive. The ac- celeration equation is aA (cid:2) aB (cid:3) (aA/B)n (cid:3) (aA/B)t where, from Eqs. 5/3 and 5/9a, we may write aA (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:5) OA (cid:2) ((cid:2) OA (cid:2) rA) OA (cid:2) rA (cid:3) (cid:2) k) (cid:2) ((cid:5)3 OAk (cid:2) 100j (cid:3) ((cid:5)3 7 7 2 OAi (cid:5) 100(3 7) CB (cid:2) ((cid:2) CB (cid:2) rB (cid:3) (cid:2) CB (cid:2) rB) j mm/s2 (cid:2) (cid:5)100(cid:5) aB (cid:2) (cid:3) k (cid:2) 100j) (cid:2) 0 (cid:3) 2k (cid:2) (2k (cid:2) [(cid:5)75i]) (cid:2) 300i mm/s2 AB (cid:2) ((cid:2) AB (cid:2) rA/B) (aA/B)n (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:5)6 7 2 (cid:2) (6 7) (aA/B)t (cid:2) (cid:3) AB (cid:2) rA/B k) (cid:2) ((cid:5)175i (cid:3) 50j)] k (cid:2) [((cid:5)6 7 (175i (cid:5) 50j) mm/s2 (cid:2) (cid:5) ABk (cid:2) ((cid:5)175i (cid:3) 50j) (cid:2) (cid:5)50(cid:5) ABi (cid:5) 175(cid:5) AB j mm/s2 We now substitute these results into the relative-acceleration equation and equate separately the coefficients of the i-terms and the coefficients of the j-terms to give (cid:5)100(cid:5) OA (cid:2) 429 (cid:5) 50(cid:5) AB The solutions are (cid:5)18.37 (cid:2) (cid:5)36.7 (cid:5) 175(cid:5) AB AB (cid:2) (cid:5)0.1050 rad/s2 (cid:5) and (cid:5) OA (cid:2) (cid:5)4.34 rad/s2 Ans. Since the unit vector k points out from the paper in the positive z-direction, we see that the angular accelerations of AB and OA are both clockwise (negative). It is recommended that the student sketch each of the acceleration vectors in its proper geometric relationship according to the relative-acceleration equa- tion to help clarify the meaning of the solution. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 376 376 Chapter 5 Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies SAMPLE PROBLEM 5/15 The slider-crank mechanism of Sample Problem 5/9 is repeated here. The crank OB has a constant clockwise angular speed of 1500 rev/min. For the in- stant when the crank angle (cid:2) is 60(cid:2), determine the acceleration of the piston A and the angular acceleration of the connecting rod AB. A 1 0 ″ B G 4 ″ θ O r = 5″ ω Solution. The acceleration of A may be expressed in terms of the acceleration of the crank pin B. Thus, aA (cid:2) aB (cid:3) (aA/B)n (cid:3) (aA/B)t Point B moves in a circle of 5-in. radius with a constant speed so that it has only a normal component of acceleration directed from B to O.

From Sample Problem 5/9, the angular velocity of AB for these same conditions is (cid:4)AB (cid:2) 29.5 rad/sec so that (cid:3) [an (cid:2) r(cid:4)2] (aA/B)n (cid:2) 14 12 (29.5)2 (cid:2) 1015 ft/sec2 directed from A to B. The tangential component (aA/B)t is known in direction only since its magnitude depends on the unknown angular acceleration of AB. We also know the direction of aA since the piston is conﬁned to move along the horizontal axis of the cylinder. There are now only two scalar unknowns left in the equation, namely, the magnitudes of aA and (aA/B)t, so the solution can be carried out. If we adopt an algebraic solution using the geometry of the acceleration polygon, we ﬁrst compute the angle between AB and the horizontal. With the law of sines, this angle becomes 18.02(cid:2). Equating separately the horizontal com- ponents and the vertical components of the terms in the acceleration equation, as seen from the acceleration polygon, gives aA (cid:2) 10,280 cos 60(cid:2) (cid:3) 1015 cos 18.02(cid:2) (cid:5) (aA/B)t sin 18.02(cid:2) 0 (cid:2) 10,280 sin 60(cid:2) (cid:5) 1015 sin 18.02(cid:2) (cid:5) (aA/B)t cos 18.02(cid:2) Helpful Hints (cid:2) If the crank OB had an angular ac- celeration, aB would also have a tan- gential component of acceleration. (cid:3) Alternatively, the relation an (cid:2) v2/r may be used for calculating (aA/B)n, provided the relative velocity vA/B is used for v. The equivalence is easily seen when it is recalled that vA/B (cid:2) r(cid:4). α AB n B ω = 29.5 AB rad/sec t (aA/B)t A (aA/B)n aA P 60° The solution to these equations gives the magnitudes (aA/B)t (cid:2) 9030 ft/sec2 and aA (cid:2) 3310 ft/sec2 Ans. With the sense of (aA/B)t also determined from the diagram, the angular accelera- tion of AB is seen from the ﬁgure representing rotation relative to B to be aB = 10,280 ft/sec2 (aA/B)t 18.02° 18.02° [(cid:5) (cid:2) at /r] AB (cid:2) 9030/(14/12) (cid:2) 7740 rad/sec2 clockwise (cid:5) Ans. (aA/B)n = 1015 ft/sec2 (cid:4) If we adopt a graphical solution, we begin with the known vectors aB and (aA/B)n and add them head-to-tail using a convenient scale. Next we construct the direction of (aA/B)t through the head of the last vector. The solution of the equa- tion is obtained by the intersection P of this last line with a horizontal line through the starting point representing the known direction of the vector sum aA. Scaling the magnitudes from the diagram gives values which agree with the calculated results. aA (cid:2) 3310 ft/sec2 and (aA/B)t (cid:2) 9030 ft/sec2 Ans. (cid:4) Except where extreme accuracy is required, do not hesitate to use a graphical solution, as it is quick and reveals the physical relationships among the vectors. The known vec- tors, of course, may be added in any order as long as the governing equa- tion is satisﬁed. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 377 PROBLEMS Introductory Problems 5/121 The center O of the wheel is mounted on the sliding to the and .

Use of rotating reference axes greatly facilitates the solution of many problems in kine- matics where motion is generated within a system or observed from a system which itself is rotating. An example of such a motion is the movement of a ﬂuid particle along the curved vane of a centrifugal pump, where the path relative to the vanes of the impeller becomes an important design consideration. We begin the description of motion using rotating axes by consider- ing the plane motion of two particles A and B in the ﬁxed X-Y plane, Fig. 5/10a. For the time being, we will consider A and B to be moving inde- pendently of one another for the sake of generality. We observe the mo- tion of A from a moving reference frame x-y which has its origin attached to B and which rotates with an angular velocity (cid:4) (cid:2) . We may write this angular velocity as the vector (cid:2) = (cid:4)k (cid:2) k, where the vector is normal to the plane of motion and where its positive sense is in the positive z-direction (out from the paper), as established by the right- hand rule. The absolute position vector of A is given by (cid:2)˙ (cid:2)˙ rA (cid:2) rB (cid:3) r (cid:2) rB (cid:3) (xi (cid:3) yj) (5/10) where i and j are unit vectors attached to the x-y frame and r (cid:2) xi (cid:3) yj stands for rA/B, the position vector of A with respect to B. Time Derivatives of Unit Vectors To obtain the velocity and acceleration equations we must succes- sively differentiate the position-vector equation with respect to time. In contrast to the case of translating axes treated in Art. 2/8, the unit vec- tors i and j are now rotating with the x-y axes and, therefore, have time derivatives which must be evaluated. These derivatives may be seen from Fig. 5/10b, which shows the inﬁnitesimal change in each unit vec- tor during time dt as the reference axes rotate through an angle d(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4) dt. The differential change in i is di, and it has the direction of j and a magnitude equal to the angle d(cid:2) times the length of the vector i, which is unity. Thus, di (cid:2) d(cid:2) j. Similarly, the unit vector j has an inﬁnitesimal change dj which points in the negative x-direction, so that dj (cid:2) (cid:5)d(cid:2) i. Dividing by dt and i˙ replacing di/dt by (cid:2)˙ , and d(cid:2)/dt by (cid:2) (cid:4) result in , dj/dt by j˙ i˙ (cid:2) (cid:4)j and j˙ (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:4)i By using the cross product, we can see from Fig. 5/10c that (cid:2) (cid:2) i = (cid:4)j and (cid:2) (cid:2) j (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:4)i. Thus, the time derivatives of the unit vectors may be written as i˙ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) i and j˙ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) j (5/11) A y Y rA r = rA/B x ·θω = θ O y dθ B rB (a) X θ dj = – d i j i (b) z dθ x θ di = d j y × iω ω k i j × jω (c) x Figure 5/10 c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 386 386 Chapter 5 Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies Relative Velocity We now use the expressions of Eqs. 5/11 when taking the time de- rivative of the position-vector equation for A and B to obtain the rela- tive-velocity relation.

Thus, the relative-velocity equation becomes (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) r. Also, since the y˙ , we see that (cid:2) vrel, which is the velocity relative to the x-y frame of refer- and x˙ vA/B y vrel = vA/P Y ×× r = ω vP/B A s P (fixed to path and coincident with A) x r B ω rB Path of A X Figure 5/11 O vA (cid:2) vB (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) r (cid:3) vrel (5/12) Comparison of Eq. 5/12 with Eq. 2/20 for nonrotating reference axes shows that vA/B (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) r (cid:3) vrel, from which we conclude that the term (cid:2) (cid:2) r is the difference between the relative velocities as measured from nonrotating and rotating axes. To illustrate further the meaning of the last two terms in Eq. 5/12, the motion of particle A relative to the rotating x-y plane is shown in Fig. 5/11 as taking place in a curved slot in a plate which represents the rotating x-y reference system. The velocity of A as measured relative to the plate, vrel, would be tangent to the path ﬁxed in the x-y plate and s˙ would have a magnitude , where s is measured along the path. This rel- ative velocity may also be viewed as the velocity vA/P relative to a point P attached to the plate and coincident with A at the instant under consid- eration. The term (cid:2) (cid:2) r has a magnitude and a direction normal to r and is the velocity relative to B of point P as seen from nonrotating axes attached to B. r (cid:2)˙ The following comparison will help establish the equivalence of, and clarify the differences between, the relative-velocity equations written for rotating and nonrotating reference axes: (5/12a) In the second equation, the term vP/B is measured from a nonrotating position—otherwise, it would be zero. The term vA/P is the same as vrel and is the velocity of A as measured in the x-y frame. In the third equa- tion, vP is the absolute velocity of P and represents the effect of the moving coordinate system, both translational and rotational. The fourth equation is the same as that developed for nonrotating axes, Eq. 2/20, and it is seen that vA/B (cid:2) vP/B + vA/P = (cid:2) (cid:2) r (cid:3) vrel. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 387 Article 5/7 Motion Relative to Rotating Axes 387 Transformation of a Time Derivative Equation 5/12 represents a transformation of the time derivative of the position vector between rotating and nonrotating axes. We may eas- ily generalize this result to apply to the time derivative of any vector quantity V (cid:2) Vxi (cid:3) Vy j. Accordingly, the total time derivative with re- spect to the X-Y system is (cid:5)dV dt (cid:6) XY (cid:2) (V˙ xi (cid:3) V˙ j) (cid:3) (Vx i˙ (cid:3) Vy j˙) y The ﬁrst two terms in the expression represent that part of the total de- rivative of V which is measured relative to the x-y reference system, and the second two terms represent that part of the derivative due to the ro- tation of the reference system. i˙ from Eqs. 5/11, we may now write With the expressions for and j˙ (cid:5)dV dt (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:5)dV (cid:6) dt xy XY (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) V (5/13) Here (cid:2) (cid:2) V represents the difference between the time derivative of the vector as measured in a ﬁxed reference system and its time derivative as measured in the rotating reference system. As we will see in Art. 7/2, where three-dimensional motion is introduced, Eq. 5/13 is valid in three dimensions, as well as in two dimensions. The physical signiﬁcance of Eq. 5/13 is illustrated in Fig. 5/12, which shows the vector V at time t as observed both in the ﬁxed axes X-Y and in the rotating axes x-y. Because we are dealing with the effects of rotation only, we may draw the vector through the coordinate origin without loss of generality. During time dt, the vector swings to position V(cid:2), and the observer in x-y measures the two components (a) dV due to its change in magnitude and (b) V d(cid:3) due to its rotation d(cid:3) relative to x-y. To the rotating observer, then, the derivative (dV/dt)xy which the observer measures has the components dV/dt and V d(cid:3)/dt (cid:2) . The re- maining part of the total time derivative not measured by the rotating observer has the magnitude V d(cid:2)/dt and, expressed as a vector, is (cid:2) (cid:2) V. Thus, we see from the diagram that V(cid:3)˙ (V˙)XY (cid:2) (V˙)xy (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) V which is Eq. 5/13.

The terms shown in Fig. 5/13. They represent, respectively, the tangential and nor- mal components of the acceleration aP/B of the coincident point P in its circular motion with respect to B.

The magnitude of (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r) is r(cid:4)2 and its direction is from P to B along the normal to the circle.

Frequently, n- and t-components are used, and these components are depicted in Fig. 5/13. The tangential component has the magnitude (arel)t (cid:2) , where s is the distance measured along 2/(cid:7) the path to A. The normal component has the magnitude (arel)n (cid:2) , where (cid:7) is the radius of curvature of the path as measured in x-y. The sense of this vector is always toward the center of curvature. vrel s¨ Coriolis Acceleration The term 2(cid:2) (cid:2) vrel, shown in Fig. 5/13, is called the Coriolis acceler- ation.* It represents the difference between the acceleration of A rela- tive to P as measured from nonrotating axes and from rotating axes. *Named after the French military engineer G. Coriolis (1792–1843), who was the ﬁrst to call attention to this term. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 389 The direction is always normal to the vector vrel, and the sense is estab- lished by the right-hand rule for the cross product. Article 5/7 Motion Relative to Rotating Axes 389 The Coriolis acceleration aCor (cid:2) 2(cid:2) (cid:2) vrel is difﬁcult to visualize be- cause it is composed of two separate physical effects. To help with this visualization, we will consider the simplest possible motion in which this term appears. In Fig. 5/14a we have a rotating disk with a radial slot in which a small particle A is conﬁned to slide. Let the disk turn with a constant angular velocity (cid:4) (cid:2) and let the particle move along the slot with a constant speed vrel (cid:2) relative to the slot. The velocity of x˙ A has the two components (a) due to motion along the slot and (b) x(cid:4) due to the rotation of the slot. The changes in these two velocity compo- nents due to the rotation of the disk are shown in part b of the ﬁgure for the interval dt, during which the x-y axes rotate with the disk through the angle d(cid:2) to x(cid:2)-y(cid:2). (cid:2)˙ x˙ x˙ The velocity increment due to the change in direction of vrel is d(cid:2) and that due to the change in magnitude of x(cid:4) is (cid:4) dx, both being in the y-direction normal to the slot. Dividing each increment by dt and adding give the sum , which is the magnitude of the Coriolis ac- celeration 2(cid:2) (cid:2) vrel. (cid:4)x˙ (cid:3) x˙(cid:4) (cid:2) 2x˙(cid:4) Dividing the remaining velocity increment x(cid:4) d(cid:2) due to the change in direction of x(cid:4) by dt gives x(cid:4) or x(cid:4)2, which is the acceleration of a point P ﬁxed to the slot and momentarily coincident with the particle A. We now see how Eq. 5/14 ﬁts these results. With the origin B in that equation taken at the ﬁxed center O, aB (cid:2) 0. With constant angular ve- . With vrel constant in magnitude and no curvature to locity, the slot, arel (cid:2) 0. We are left with (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) r (cid:2) 0 (cid:2)˙ aA (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r) (cid:3) 2(cid:2) (cid:2) vrel Replacing r by xi, (cid:2) by (cid:4)k, and vrel by x˙i gives aA (cid:2) (cid:5)x(cid:4)2i (cid:3) 2x˙(cid:4)j which checks our analysis from Fig. 5/14. We also note that this same result is contained in our polar-coordinate analysis of plane curvilinear motion in Eq. 2/14 when we let (cid:2) 0 and (cid:2)¨ by (cid:4). If the slot in the disk of Fig. 5/14 had been curved, we would have had a normal component of accelera- tion relative to the slot so that arel would not be zero. (cid:2) 0 and replace r by x and (cid:2)˙ r¨ Rotating versus Nonrotating Systems The following comparison will help to establish the equivalence of, and clarify the differences between, the relative-acceleration equations written for rotating and nonrotating reference axes: (5/14a) Y y ω = constant xω A O x x · = constant vrel = x X (a) y y′ x′ · dθ x x ω ω d(x ) = dx + x d ω = dx + 0 ω xω dθ xω dθ · vrel = x dθ (b) Figure 5/14 c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 390 390 Chapter 5 Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies (cid:2)˙ The equivalence of aP/B and (cid:2) r (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r), as shown in the sec- ond equation, has already been described. From the third equation where aB (cid:3) aP/B has been combined to give aP, it is seen that the rela- tive-acceleration term aA/P, unlike the corresponding relative-velocity term, is not equal to the relative acceleration arel measured from the ro- tating x-y frame of reference. The Coriolis term is, therefore, the difference between the accelera- tion aA/P of A relative to P as measured in a nonrotating system and the acceleration arel of A relative to P as measured in a rotating system. From the fourth equation, it is seen that the acceleration aA/B of A with respect to B as measured in a nonrotating system, Eq. 2/21, is a combina- tion of the last four terms in the ﬁrst equation for the rotating system. The results expressed by Eq. 5/14 may be visualized somewhat more simply by writing the acceleration of A in terms of the acceleration of the coincident point P. Because the acceleration of P is aP (cid:2) aB (cid:3) (cid:2) r (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r), we may rewrite Eq. 5/14 as (cid:2)˙ aA (cid:2) aP (cid:3) 2(cid:2) (cid:2) vrel (cid:3) arel (5/14b) When the equation is written in this form, point P may not be picked at random because it is the one point attached to the rotating reference frame coincident with A at the instant of analysis. Again, reference to Fig. 5/13 should be made to clarify the meaning of each of the terms in Eq. 5/14 and its equivalent, Eq. 5/14b. KEY CONCEPTS In summary, once we have chosen our rotating reference system, we must recognize the following quantities in Eqs. 5/12 and 5/14: vB (cid:2) absolute velocity of the origin B of the rotating axes aB (cid:2) absolute acceleration of the origin B of the rotating axes r (cid:2) position vector of the coincident point P measured from B (cid:2) (cid:2) angular velocity of the rotating axes (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) angular acceleration of the rotating axes vrel (cid:2) velocity of A measured relative to the rotating axes arel (cid:2) acceleration of A measured relative to the rotating axes Also, keep in mind that our vector analysis depends on the consis- tent use of a right-handed set of coordinate axes. Finally, note that Eqs. 5/12 and 5/14, developed here for plane motion, hold equally well for space motion. The extension to space motion will be covered in Art. 7/6. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 391 SAMPLE PROBLEM 5/16 Article 5/7 Motion Relative to Rotating Axes 391 At the instant represented, the disk with the radial slot is rotating about O with a counterclockwise angular velocity of 4 rad/sec which is decreasing at the rate of 10 rad/sec2.

The angular velocity of OD is (cid:4) (cid:2) 2 rad/s clockwise and is constant for the interval of motion concerned. For the position where (cid:2) (cid:2) 45(cid:2) with AC hori- zontal, determine the velocity of pin A and the velocity of A relative to the rotat- ing slot in OD. Solution. Motion of a point (pin A) along a rotating path (the slot) suggests the use of rotating coordinate axes x-y attached to arm OD. With the origin at the ﬁxed point O, the term vB of Eq. 5/12 vanishes, and we have vA (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) r (cid:3) vrel. The velocity of A in its circular motion about C is vA (cid:2) (cid:2) CA (cid:2) rCA (cid:2) (cid:4) CAk (cid:2) (225/(cid:4)2)((cid:5)i (cid:5) j) (cid:2) (225/(cid:4)2)(cid:4) CA (i (cid:5) j) (cid:2) where the angular velocity (cid:2)CA is arbitrarily assigned in a clockwise sense in the positive z-direction ((cid:3)k). The angular velocity (cid:2) of the rotating axes is that of the arm OD and, by the right-hand rule, is (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)k (cid:2) 2k rad/s. The vector from the origin to the point P on OD coincident with A is r (cid:2) mm. Thus, OPi (cid:2) (cid:4)(450 (cid:5) 225)2 (cid:3) (225)2 i (cid:2) 225(cid:4)2i (cid:2) (cid:2) r (cid:2) 2k (cid:2) 225(cid:4)2i (cid:2) 450(cid:4)2j mm/s Finally, the relative-velocity term vrel is the velocity measured by an ob- server attached to the rotating reference frame and is vrel (cid:2) . Substitution into the relative-velocity equation gives x˙i (225/(cid:4)2)(cid:4) CA (i (cid:5) j) (cid:2) 450(cid:4)2j (cid:3) x˙i Equating separately the coefﬁcients of the i and j terms yields (225/(cid:4)2)(cid:4) CA (cid:2) x˙ and (cid:5)(225/(cid:4)2)(cid:4) CA (cid:2) 450(cid:4)2 giving (cid:4) CA (cid:2) (cid:5)4 rad/s and x˙ (cid:2) vrel (cid:2) (cid:5)450(cid:4)2 mm/s Ans. With a negative value for (cid:4)CA, the actual angular velocity of CA is counterclock- wise, so the velocity of A is up with a magnitude of (cid:3) vA (cid:2) 225(4) (cid:2) 900 mm/s Ans. OP (2) = (cid:4) (cid:2) 225 Geometric clariﬁcation of the terms is helpful and is easily shown. Using the equivalence between the third and the ﬁrst of Eqs. 5/12a with vB (cid:2) 0 enables us to write vA (cid:2) vP (cid:3) vA/P, where P is the point on the rotating arm OD coinci- dent with A. Clearly, vP (cid:2) (cid:4)2 mm/s and its direction is normal to OD. The relative velocity vA/P, which is the same as vrel, is seen from the ﬁgure to be along the slot toward O. This conclusion becomes clear when it is ob- served that A is approaching P along the slot from below before coincidence and is receding from P upward along the slot following coincidence. The velocity of A is tangent to its circular arc about C. The vector equation can now be satisﬁed since there are only two remaining scalar unknowns, namely, the magnitude of vA/P and the magnitude of vA. For the 45(cid:2) position, the ﬁgure requires vA/P (cid:2) 450(cid:4)2 mm/s and vA (cid:2) 900 mm/s, each in its direction shown. The angular velocity of AC is 450(cid:4)2 [(cid:4) (cid:2) v/r] AC (cid:2) vA / AC (cid:2) 900/225 (cid:2) 4 rad/s counterclockwise (cid:4) y 450 mm 225 mm 225 mm C x D C A P P A A P = 45° θ O ω = 2 rad /s A O = v rel v A / P vA 45° vP = ë rv Helpful Hints (cid:2) It is clear enough physically that CA will have a counterclockwise angular velocity for the conditions speciﬁed, so we anticipate a negative value for (cid:4)CA. (cid:3) Solution of the problem is not re- stricted to the reference axes used. Al- ternatively, the origin of the x-y axes, still attached to OD, could be chosen at the coincident point P on OD. This choice would merely replace the (cid:2) (cid:2) r term by its equal, vP.

We approached the problem in two ways. 1. Absolute-Motion Analysis First, we wrote an equation which describes the general geometric conﬁguration of a given problem in terms of knowns and unknowns. Then we differentiated this equation with respect to time to obtain ve- locities and accelerations, both linear and angular. 2. Relative-Motion Analysis We applied the principles of relative motion to rigid bodies and found that this approach enables us to solve many problems which are too awkward to handle by mathematical differentiation. The relative- velocity equation, the instantaneous center of zero velocity, and the relative-acceleration equation all require that we visualize clearly and analyze correctly the case of circular motion of one point around an- other point, as viewed from nonrotating axes. Solution of the Velocity and Acceleration Equations The relative-velocity and relative-acceleration relationships are vec- tor equations which we may solve in any one of three ways: 1. by a scalar-geometric analysis of the vector polygon, 2. by vector algebra, or 3. by a graphical construction of the vector polygon. Rotating Coordinate Systems Finally, in Chapter 5 we introduced rotating coordinate systems which enable us to solve problems where the motion is observed relative to a rotating frame of reference. Whenever a point moves along a path which itself is turning, analysis by rotating axes is indicated if a relative- motion approach is used. In deriving Eq. 5/12 for velocity and Eq. 5/14 for acceleration, where the relative terms are measured from a rotating reference system, it was necessary for us to account for the time deriva- tives of the unit vectors i and j ﬁxed to the rotating frame. Equations 5/12 and 5/14 also apply to spatial motion, as will be shown in Chapter 7. An important result of the analysis of rotating coordinate systems is the identiﬁcation of the Coriolis acceleration. This acceleration repre- sents the fact that the absolute velocity vector may have changes in both direction and magnitude due to rotation of the relative-velocity vector and change in position of the particle along the rotating path. In Chapter 6 we will study the kinetics of rigid bodies in plane mo- tion. There we will ﬁnd that the ability to analyze the linear and angular accelerations of rigid bodies is necessary in order to apply the force and moment equations which relate the applied forces to the associated mo- tions. Thus, the material of Chapter 5 is essential to that in Chapter 6. c05.qxd 2/10/12 10:08 AM Page 403 REVIEW PROBLEMS 5/185 The frictional resistance to the rotation of a ﬂy- wheel consists of a retardation due to air friction which varies as the square of the angular velocity and a constant frictional retardation in the bear- ing.

In Chapter 5 we developed the kinematic relationships for the plane motion of rigid bodies, and we will use these relationships extensively in this present chapter, where the effects of forces on the two-dimensional motion of rigid bodies are examined. For our purpose in this chapter, a body which can be approximated as a thin slab with its motion conﬁned to the plane of the slab will be considered to be in plane motion. The plane of motion will contain the mass center, and all forces which act on the body will be projected onto the plane of motion. A body which has appreciable dimensions normal to the plane of motion but is symmetrical about that plane of motion through the mass center may be treated as having plane motion. These idealizations clearly ﬁt a very large category of rigid-body motions. 411 c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 412 412 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies Background for the Study of Kinetics In Chapter 3 we found that two force equations of motion were re- quired to deﬁne the motion of a particle whose motion is conﬁned to a plane. For the plane motion of a rigid body, an additional equation is needed to specify the state of rotation of the body. Thus, two force equa- tions and one moment equation or their equivalent are required to de- termine the state of rigid-body plane motion. The kinetic relationships which form the basis for most of the analysis of rigid-body motion were developed in Chapter 4 for a general system of particles. Frequent reference will be made to these equations as they are further developed in Chapter 6 and applied speciﬁcally to the plane motion of rigid bodies. You should refer to Chapter 4 frequently as you study Chapter 6. Also, before proceeding make sure that you have a ﬁrm grasp of the calculation of velocities and accelerations as developed in Chapter 5 for rigid-body plane motion. Unless you can determine ac- celerations correctly from the principles of kinematics, you frequently will be unable to apply the force and moment principles of kinetics. Con- sequently, you should master the necessary kinematics, including the calculation of relative accelerations, before proceeding. Successful application of kinetics requires that you isolate the body or system to be analyzed. The isolation technique was illustrated and used in Chapter 3 for particle kinetics and will be employed consis- tently in the present chapter. For problems involving the instanta- neous relationships among force, mass, and acceleration, the body or system should be explicitly deﬁned by isolating it with its free-body dia- gram. When the principles of work and energy are employed, an active- force diagram which shows only those external forces which do work on the system may be used in lieu of the free-body diagram. The impulse- momentum diagram should be constructed when impulse-momentum methods are used. No solution of a problem should be attempted with- out ﬁrst deﬁning the complete external boundary of the body or system and identifying all external forces which act on it. In the kinetics of rigid bodies which have angular motion, we must introduce a property of the body which accounts for the radial distribu- tion of its mass with respect to a particular axis of rotation normal to the plane of motion. This property is known as the mass moment of iner- tia of the body, and it is essential that we be able to calculate this prop- erty in order to solve rotational problems. We assume that you are familiar with the calculation of mass moments of inertia. Appendix B treats this topic for those who need instruction or review. Organization of the Chapter Chapter 6 is organized in the same three sections in which we treated the kinetics of particles in Chapter 3. Section A relates the forces and moments to the instantaneous linear and angular accelera- tions. Section B treats the solution of problems by the method of work and energy. Section C covers the methods of impulse and momentum. Virtually all of the basic concepts and approaches covered in these three sections were treated in Chapter 3 on particle kinetics. This repe- tition will help you with the topics of Chapter 6, provided you understand c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 413 Article 6/2 General Equations of Motion 413 the kinematics of rigid-body plane motion. In each of the three sections, we will treat three types of motion: translation, ﬁxed-axis rotation, and general plane motion. SECTION A FORCE, MASS, AND ACCELERATION 6/2 General Equations of Motion In Arts. 4/2 and 4/4 we derived the force and moment vector equa- tions of motion for a general system of mass. We now apply these results by starting, ﬁrst, with a general rigid body in three dimensions. The force equation, Eq. 4/1, ΣF (cid:2) ma [4/1] tells us that the resultant ΣF of the external forces acting on the body equals the mass m of the body times the acceleration of its mass cen- ter G. The moment equation taken about the mass center, Eq. 4/9, a ΣMG (cid:2) H˙ G [4/9] shows that the resultant moment about the mass center of the external forces on the body equals the time rate of change of the angular momen- tum of the body about the mass center. Recall from our study of statics that a general system of forces act- ing on a rigid body may be replaced by a resultant force applied at a cho- sen point and a corresponding couple. By replacing the external forces by their equivalent force-couple system in which the resultant force acts through the mass center, we may visualize the action of the forces and the corresponding dynamic response of the body with the aid of Fig. 6/1.

Part b of the ﬁgure shows the equivalent force-couple system with the resultant force applied through G. Part c of the ﬁgure is a kinetic diagram, which repre- sents the resulting dynamic effects as speciﬁed by Eqs. 4/1 and 4/9. The equivalence between the free-body diagram and the kinetic diagram en- ables us to clearly visualize and easily remember the separate transla- tional and rotational effects of the forces applied to a rigid body. We will express this equivalence mathematically as we apply these results to the treatment of rigid-body plane motion. Plane-Motion Equations y F1 G α mi ρ i β ω – a x F4 Figure 6/2 F2 F3 We now apply the foregoing relationships to the case of plane mo- tion. Figure 6/2 represents a rigid body moving with plane motion in the x-y plane. The mass center G has an acceleration and the body has an angular velocity (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)k and an angular acceleration (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3)k, both taken positive in the z-direction. Because the z-direction of both (cid:2) and (cid:3) remains perpendicular to the plane of motion, we may use scalar notation (cid:2) and (cid:3) (cid:2) to represent the angular velocity and an- gular acceleration. a, (cid:2)˙ (cid:4)˙i mi The angular momentum about the mass center for the general sys- tem was expressed in Eq. 4/8a as HG (cid:2) Σ(cid:4)i (cid:2) where (cid:4)i is the posi- tion vector relative to G of the representative particle of mass mi. For our rigid body, the velocity of mi relative to G is (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)i, which has a magnitude (cid:4)i(cid:2) and lies in the plane of motion normal to (cid:4)i. The product (cid:4)˙i (cid:4)i (cid:2) is then a vector normal to the x-y plane in the sense of (cid:2), and its (cid:2) Thus, the magnitude of HG becomes HG (cid:2) magnitude is (cid:2)Σ(cid:4) The summation, which may also be written as (cid:2) (cid:4)2 dm, is de- 2mi.

Σ(cid:4) 2mi i 2(cid:2). i (cid:4)˙i (cid:2) (cid:4) i We may now write HG (cid:2) I(cid:2) I where is a constant property of the body. This property is a measure of the rotational inertia, which is the resistance to change in rotational ve- locity due to the radial distribution of mass around the z-axis through G. With this substitution, our moment equation, Eq. 4/9, becomes ΣMG (cid:2) H˙ G (cid:2) I(cid:2)˙ (cid:2) I(cid:3) where (cid:3) (cid:2) is the angular acceleration of the body. (cid:2)˙ We may now express the moment equation and the vector form of the generalized Newton’s second law of motion, Eq. 4/1, as ΣF (cid:2) ma ΣMG (cid:2) I(cid:3) (6/1) Equations 6/1 are the general equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion. In applying Eqs. 6/1, we express the vector force equation c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 415 Article 6/2 General Equations of Motion 415 in terms of its two scalar components using x-y, n-t, or r-(cid:5) coordinates, whichever is most convenient for the problem at hand. Alternative Derivation It is instructive to use an alternative approach to derive the mo- ment equation by referring directly to the forces which act on the repre- sentative particle of mass mi, as shown in Fig. 6/3. The acceleration of mi equals the vector sum of and the relative terms (cid:4)i(cid:2)2 and (cid:4)i(cid:3), where the mass center G is used as the reference point. It follows that the re- mi(cid:4)i(cid:2)2, and mi(cid:4)i(cid:3) in sultant of all forces on mi has the components the directions shown. The sum of the moments of these force compo- nents about G in the sense of (cid:3) becomes mi a, a MGi (cid:2) mi (cid:4) i 2(cid:3) (cid:3) (mi a sin (cid:6))xi (cid:4) (mi a cos (cid:6))yi Similar moment expressions exist for all particles in the body, and the sum of these moments about G for the resultant forces acting on all particles may be written as y xi ω mi ρα i or mi αω mi ρω 2 i G – mia β yi x ΣMG (cid:2) Σmi (cid:4) 2(cid:3) (cid:3) a sin (cid:6) Σmi xi (cid:4) a cos (cid:6) Σmi yi i Figure 6/3 But the origin of coordinates is taken at the mass center, so that Σmixi (cid:2) (cid:2) 0. Thus, the moment sum becomes (cid:2) 0 and Σmi yi (cid:2) mx my ΣMG (cid:2) Σmi (cid:4) i 2(cid:3) (cid:2) I(cid:3) as before. The contribution to ΣMG of the forces internal to the body is, of course, zero since they occur in pairs of equal and opposite forces of action and reaction between interacting particles. Thus, ΣMG, as before, represents the sum of moments about the mass center G of only the ex- ternal forces acting on the body, as disclosed by the free-body diagram. We note that the force component mi(cid:4)i(cid:2)2 has no moment about G and conclude, therefore, that the angular velocity (cid:2) has no inﬂuence on the moment equation about the mass center. The results embodied in our basic equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion, Eqs. 6/1, are represented diagrammatically in Fig. 6/4, F1 G α – a ≡ –α I G – ma F2 F3 Free-Body Diagram Kinetic Diagram Figure 6/4 c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 416 416 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies which is the two-dimensional counterpart of parts a and c of Fig. 6/1 for a general three-dimensional body. The free-body diagram discloses the forces and moments appearing on the left-hand side of our equations of motion. The kinetic diagram discloses the resulting dynamic response in terms of ma the translational term and the rotational term which appear on the right-hand side of Eqs. 6/1. I(cid:3) ma As previously mentioned, the translational term will be ex- pressed by its x-y, n-t, or r-(cid:5) components once the appropriate inertial reference system is designated. The equivalence depicted in Fig. 6/4 is basic to our understanding of the kinetics of plane motion and will be employed frequently in the solution of problems. I(cid:3) will help ensure that the force and moment sums determined from the free-body diagram are equated to their proper resultants. Representation of the resultants and ma Alternative Moment Equations In Art. 4/4 of Chapter 4 on systems of particles, we developed a gen- eral equation for moments about an arbitrary point P, Eq. 4/11, which is ΣMP (cid:2) H˙ G (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) ma [4/11] (cid:4) is the vector from P to the mass center G and where is the mass-cen- ter acceleration. As we have shown earlier in this article, for a rigid body I(cid:3). (cid:4) in plane motion is sim- ply the moment of magnitude about P. Therefore, for the two-dimensional body illustrated in Fig. 6/5 with its free-body diagram and kinetic diagram, we may rewrite Eq. 4/11 simply as Also, the cross product (cid:2) becomes mad ma ma H˙ of G a ΣMP (cid:2) I(cid:3) (cid:3) mad (6/2) Clearly, all three terms are positive in the counterclockwise sense for the example shown, and the choice of P eliminates reference to F1 and F3. If we had wished to eliminate reference to F2 and F3, for example, by choosing their intersection as the reference point, then P would lie vector, and the clockwise moment of ma on the opposite side of the ma α P – a ≡ G d – ma –ρ P G –α I F1 F2 F3 Free-Body Diagram Kinetic Diagram Figure 6/5 c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 417 Article 6/2 General Equations of Motion 417 about P would be a negative term in the equation. Equation 6/2 is easily remembered as it is merely an expression of the familiar principle of mo- ments, where the sum of the moments about P equals the combined mo- I(cid:3) ment about P of their sum, expressed by the resultant couple ΣMG (cid:2) and the resultant force ΣF (cid:2) ma. In Art. 4/4 we also developed an alternative moment equation about P, Eq. 4/13, which is ΣMP (cid:2) (H˙ P)rel (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) maP [4/13] For rigid-body plane motion, if P is chosen as a point ﬁxed to the body, becomes IP(cid:3), where IP is the mass moment of then in scalar form inertia about an axis through P and (cid:3) is the angular acceleration of the body. So we may write the equation as P)rel (H˙ ΣMP (cid:2) IP (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) maP (6/3) (cid:4) where the acceleration of P is aP and the position vector from P to G is (cid:4). When (cid:2) 0, point P becomes the mass center G, and Eq. 6/3 re- I(cid:3), duces to the scalar form ΣMG (cid:2) previously derived. When point P becomes a point O ﬁxed in an inertial reference system and attached to the body (or body extended), then aP (cid:2) 0, and Eq. 6/3 in scalar form re- duces to (cid:3) ΣMO (cid:2) IO (6/4) Equation 6/4 then applies to the rotation of a rigid body about a nonac- celerating point O ﬁxed to the body and is the two-dimensional simpliﬁ- cation of Eq. 4/7. Unconstrained and Constrained Motion The motion of a rigid body may be unconstrained or constrained. The rocket moving in a vertical plane, Fig. 6/6a, is an example of uncon- strained motion as there are no physical conﬁnements to its motion. α – a y G – a x y T mg x A F – a y G y α – a x x B (a) Unconstrained Motion (b) Constrained Motion Figure 6/6 c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 418 418 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies The two components of the mass-center acceleration and the angular acceleration (cid:3) may be determined independently of one another by direct application of Eqs. 6/1. and ax ay The bar in Fig. 6/6b, on the other hand, undergoes a constrained motion, where the vertical and horizontal guides for the ends of the bar impose a kinematic relationship between the acceleration com- ponents of the mass center and the angular acceleration of the bar. Thus, it is necessary to determine this kinematic relationship from the principles established in Chapter 5 and to combine it with the force and moment equations of motion before a solution can be car- ried out. In general, dynamics problems which involve physical constraints to motion require a kinematic analysis relating linear to angular accelera- tion before the force and moment equations of motion can be solved. It is for this reason that an understanding of the principles and methods of Chapter 5 is so vital to the work of Chapter 6. Systems of Interconnected Bodies Upon occasion, in problems dealing with two or more connected rigid bodies whose motions are related kinematically, it is convenient to analyze the bodies as an entire system. Figure 6/7 illustrates two rigid bodies hinged at A and subjected to the external forces shown. The forces in the connection at A are internal to the system and are not disclosed. The resultant of all external forces must equal the vector sum of the two resultants and the sum of the moments about some arbitrary point such as P of all external (cid:3) forces must equal the moment of the resultants, m2a2d2.

If there are more than three remaining unknowns in a system, how- ever, the three independent scalar equations of motion, when applied to the system, are not sufﬁcient to solve the problem. In this case, more ad- vanced methods such as virtual work (Art. 6/7) or Lagrange’s equations (not discussed in this book*) could be employed, or else the system could be dismembered and each part analyzed separately with the resulting equations solved simultaneously. KEY CONCEPTS Analysis Procedure In the solution of force-mass-acceleration problems for the plane motion of rigid bodies, the following steps should be taken once you un- derstand the conditions and requirements of the problem: 1. Kinematics. First, identify the class of motion and then solve for any needed linear and angular accelerations which can be deter- mined solely from given kinematic information. In the case of con- strained plane motion, it is usually necessary to establish the relation between the linear acceleration of the mass center and the angular ac- celeration of the body by ﬁrst solving the appropriate relative-velocity and relative-acceleration equations. Again, we emphasize that success in working force-mass-acceleration problems in this chapter is contingent on the ability to describe the necessary kinematics, so that frequent re- view of Chapter 5 is recommended. 2. Diagrams. Always draw the complete free-body diagram of the body to be analyzed. Assign a convenient inertial coordinate system and label all known and unknown quantities. The kinetic diagram should also be constructed so as to clarify the equivalence between the applied forces and the resulting dynamic response. 3. Equations of Motion. Apply the three equations of motion from Eqs. 6/1, being consistent with the algebraic signs in relation to the choice of reference axes. Equation 6/2 or 6/3 may be employed as an alternative to the second of Eqs. 6/1. Combine these relations with the results from any needed kinematic analysis. Count the number of unknowns and be certain that there are an equal number of indepen- dent equations available. For a solvable rigid-body problem in plane motion, there can be no more than the five scalar unknowns which can be determined from the three scalar equations of motion, obtained from Eqs. 6/1, and the two scalar component relations which come from the relative-acceleration equation. *When an interconnected system has more than one degree of freedom, that is, requires more than one coordinate to specify completely the conﬁguration of the system, the more advanced equations of Lagrange are generally used. See the ﬁrst author’s Dynamics, 2nd Edition, SI Version, 1975, John Wiley & Sons, for a treatment of Lagrange’s equations. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 420 420 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies In the following three articles the foregoing developments will be applied to three cases of motion in a plane: translation, ﬁxed-axis rota- tion, and general plane motion. 6/3 Translation Rigid-body translation in plane motion was described in Art. 5/1 and illustrated in Figs. 5/1a and 5/1b, where we saw that every line in a trans- lating body remains parallel to its original position at all times. In recti- linear translation all points move in straight lines, whereas in curvilinear translation all points move on congruent curved paths. In either case, there is no angular motion of the translating body, so that both (cid:2) and (cid:3) are zero. Therefore, from the moment relation of Eqs. 6/1, we see that all reference to the moment of inertia is eliminated for a translating body.

For curvilinear translation, Fig. 6/8b, if we use n-t coordinates, the two scalar force equations become ΣFn (cid:2) In both cases, ΣMG (cid:2) 0. We may also employ the alternative moment equation, Eq. 6/2, with the aid of the kinetic diagram. For rectilinear translation we see and ΣMA (cid:2) 0. For curvilinear translation the kinetic that ΣMP (cid:2) diagram permits us to write ΣMA (cid:2) in the clockwise sense and ΣMB (cid:2) in the counterclockwise sense. Thus, we have complete freedom to choose a convenient moment center. mandA mat dB mat. mad l y m a A / r e y a S d a w o H © r The methods of this article apply to this motorcycle if its roll (lean) angle is constant for an interval of time. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 422 422 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/1 The pickup truck weighs 3220 lb and reaches a speed of 30 mi/hr from rest in a distance of 200 ft up the 10-percent incline with constant acceleration. Cal- culate the normal force under each pair of wheels and the friction force under the rear driving wheels. The effective coefﬁcient of friction between the tires and the road is known to be at least 0.8. G 24″ 60″ 1 60″ 10 (cid:2) Solution. We will assume that the mass of the wheels is negligible compared with the total mass of the truck. The truck may now be simulated by a single rigid body in rectilinear translation with an acceleration of (cid:3) [v2 (cid:2) 2as] a (cid:2) (44)2 2(200) (cid:2) 4.84 ft/sec2 The free-body diagram of the complete truck shows the normal forces N1 and N2, the friction force F in the direction to oppose the slipping of the dri- ving wheels, and the weight W represented by its two components.

Since our coefﬁcient of friction is at least 0.8, the surfaces are rough enough to support the calculated value of F so that our result is correct. Alternative Solution. From the kinetic diagram we see that N1 and N2 can be obtained independently of one another by writing separate moment equations about A and B.

(cid:3) Recall that 30 mi/hr is 44 ft/sec. y 1 F 10 θ W sin B N2 x A θ W cos θ N1 ≡ B ma A (cid:4) We must be careful not to use the friction equation F (cid:2) (cid:7)N here since we do not have a case of slipping or impending slipping. If the given co- efﬁcient of friction were less than 0.46, the friction force would be (cid:7)N2, and the car would be unable to attain the acceleration of 4.84 ft/sec2. In this case, the unknowns would be N1, N2, and a. (cid:5) The left-hand side of the equation is evaluated from the free-body dia- gram, and the right-hand side from the kinetic diagram. The positive sense for the moment sum is arbi- trary but must be the same for both sides of the equation. In this prob- lem, we have taken the clockwise sense as positive for the moment of the resultant force about B. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 423 SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/2 The vertical bar AB has a mass of 150 kg with center of mass G midway be- tween the ends.

The motion of the bar is seen to be curvilinear translation since the bar itself does not rotate during the motion.

For this motion, we saw that all points in the body describe circles about the rotation axis, and all lines of the body in the plane of motion have the same angular velocity (cid:2) and angu- lar acceleration (cid:3). r(cid:3), The acceleration components of the mass center for circular mo- tion are most easily expressed in n-t coordinates, so we have an (cid:2) r(cid:2)2 and at (cid:2) as shown in Fig. 6/9a for rotation of the rigid body about the fixed axis through O.

Choice of Coordinate System. The force equation of Eq. 6/1 should be expressed in whatever coordinate system most readily describes the acceleration of the mass center. You should consider rectangular, normal-tangential, and polar coordinates. Choice of Moment Equation. In Art. 6/2 we also showed, with the aid of Fig. 6/5, the application of the alternative relation for moments about any point P, Eq. 6/2. This ﬁgure and this equation are also re- peated here for easy reference. ΣMP (cid:2) I(cid:3) (cid:3) mad [6/2] In some instances, it may be more convenient to use the alternative mo- ment relation of Eq. 6/3 when moments are taken about a point P whose acceleration is known.

Constrained versus Unconstrained Motion. In working a problem in general plane motion, we ﬁrst observe whether the motion is uncon- strained or constrained, as illustrated in the examples of Fig. 6/6. If the motion is constrained, we must account for the kinematic relationship between the linear and the angular accelerations and incorporate it into our force and moment equations of motion. If the motion is uncon- strained, the accelerations can be determined independently of one an- other by direct application of the three motion equations, Eqs. 6/1. Number of Unknowns. In order for a rigid-body problem to be solvable, the number of unknowns cannot exceed the number of inde- pendent equations available to describe them, and a check on the sufﬁ- ciency of the relationships should always be made. At the most, for plane motion we have three scalar equations of motion and two scalar components of the vector relative-acceleration equation for constrained motion. Thus, we can handle as many as ﬁve unknowns for each rigid body. Identiﬁcation of the Body or System. We emphasize the impor- tance of clearly choosing the body to be isolated and representing this isolation by a correct free-body diagram. Only after this vital step has been completed can we properly evaluate the equivalence between the external forces and their resultants. Kinematics. Of equal importance in the analysis of plane motion is a clear understanding of the kinematics involved. Very often, the difﬁ- culties experienced at this point have to do with kinematics, and a thor- ough review of the relative-acceleration relations for plane motion will be most helpful. Consistency of Assumptions. In formulating the solution to a problem, we recognize that the directions of certain forces or accelera- tions may not be known at the outset, so that it may be necessary to make initial assumptions whose validity will be proved or disproved when the solution is carried out. It is essential, however, that all as- sumptions made be consistent with the principle of action and reaction c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 445 Article 6/5 General Plane Motion 445 and with any kinematic requirements, which are also called conditions of constraint. Thus, for example, if a wheel is rolling on a horizontal surface, its cen- ter is constrained to move on a horizontal line. Furthermore, if the un- known linear acceleration a of the center of the wheel is assumed positive to the right, then the unknown angular acceleration (cid:3) will be positive in a clockwise sense in order that a (cid:2) (cid:3)r(cid:3), if we assume the wheel does not slip. Also, we note that, for a wheel which rolls without slipping, the static friction force between the wheel and its supporting surface is generally less than its maximum value, so that F (cid:3) (cid:7)sN. But if the wheel slips as it rolls, a (cid:3) r(cid:3), and a kinetic friction force is generated which is given by F (cid:2) (cid:7)kN. It may be necessary to test the validity of either assumption, slipping or no slipping, in a given problem. The difference between the coefﬁcients of sta- tic and kinetic friction, (cid:7)s and (cid:7)k, is sometimes ignored, in which case, (cid:7) is used for either or both coefﬁcients. y r e k a B a d e M i Look ahead to Prob. 6/103 to see a special-case problem involving a crash- test dummy such as the one shown here. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 446 446 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/5 A metal hoop with a radius r (cid:2) 6 in. is released from rest on the 20(cid:2) incline. If the coefﬁcients of static and kinetic friction are (cid:7)s (cid:2) 0.15 and (cid:7)k (cid:2) 0.12, deter- mine the angular acceleration (cid:3) of the hoop and the time t for the hoop to move a distance of 10 ft down the incline. Solution. The free-body diagram shows the unspeciﬁed weight mg, the normal force N, and the friction force F acting on the hoop at the contact point C with the incline.

Therefore, the hoop slips as it rolls and (cid:3) r(cid:3).

The radius of gyration of the spool about its mass center G is 250 mm, and the coefficient of static friction between the spool and the horizontal surface is 0.25. Deter- mine the tension T in the cable and the friction force F exerted by the hori- zontal surface on the spool. k α 0 250 mm B 450 mm G 150 mm Solution. The free-body diagram and the kinetic diagram of the spool are drawn as shown. The correct direction of the friction force may be assigned in this problem by observing from both diagrams that with counterclockwise angu- lar acceleration, a moment sum about point G (and also about point D) must be counterclockwise. A point on the connecting cable has an acceleration at (cid:2) r(cid:3) (cid:2) 0.25(3) (cid:2) 0.75 m/s2, which is also the horizontal component of the acceleration of point D on the spool. It will be assumed initially that the spool rolls without slipping, in which case it has a counterclockwise angular acceleration (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) 0.75/0.30 (cid:2) 2.5 rad/s2. The acceleration of the mass center G is, (aD)x/DC therefore, (cid:2) r(cid:3) (cid:2) 0.45(2.5) (cid:2) 1.125 m/s2. a With the kinematics determined, we now apply the three equations of mo- (cid:2) _ a T A y α _ k = 250 mm 70(9.81) N _ ma ≡ x G D C N F _ α I G C tion, Eqs. 6/1, [ΣFx (cid:2) max] [ΣFy (cid:2) may] F (cid:4) T (cid:2) 70((cid:4)1.125) N (cid:4) 70(9.81) (cid:2) 0 N (cid:2) 687 N (cid:3) [ΣMG (cid:2) I(cid:3)] F(0.450) (cid:4) T(0.150) (cid:2) 70(0.250)2(2.5) Solving (a) and (b) simultaneously gives F (cid:2) 75.8 N and T (cid:2) 154.6 N Ans.

Since only 75.8 N of friction force is required, we conclude that our assumption of rolling without slipping is valid. If the coefﬁcient of static friction had been 0.1, for example, then the fric- tion force would have been limited to 0.1(687) (cid:2) 68.7 N, which is less than 75.8 N, and the spool would slip. In this event, the kinematic relation (cid:2) r(cid:3) would no longer hold. With (aD)x known, the angular acceleration would be (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:4) Using this relation along with F (cid:2) (cid:7)kN (cid:2) 68.7 N, we would then re- (aD)x]/GD. solve the three equations of motion for the unknowns T, and (cid:3).

We found that these principles were especially useful in describing motion which resulted from the cumulative effect of forces acting through distances. Furthermore, when the forces were conservative, we were able to deter- mine velocity changes by analyzing the energy conditions at the begin- ning and end of the motion interval. For ﬁnite displacements, the work-energy method eliminates the necessity for determining the accel- eration and integrating it over the interval to obtain the velocity change. These same advantages are realized when we extend the work- energy principles to describe rigid-body motion. Before carrying out this extension, you should review the defini- tions and concepts of work, kinetic energy, gravitational and elastic potential energy, conservative forces, and power treated in Arts. 3/6 and 3/7 because we will apply them to rigid-body problems. You should also review Arts. 4/3 and 4/4 on the kinetics of systems of par- ticles, in which we extended the principles of Arts. 3/6 and 3/7 to en- compass any general system of mass particles, which includes rigid bodies. Work of Forces and Couples The work done by a force F has been treated in detail in Art. 3/6 and is given by U (cid:2) (cid:4) F (cid:3) dr U (cid:2) (cid:4) (F cos (cid:3)) ds or where dr is the inﬁnitesimal vector displacement of the point of applica- tion of F, as shown in Fig. 3/2a. In the equivalent scalar form of the in- tegral, (cid:3) is the angle between F and the direction of the displacement, and ds is the magnitude of the vector displacement dr. We frequently need to evaluate the work done by a couple M which acts on a rigid body during its motion. Figure 6/11 shows a couple M (cid:2) Fb acting on a rigid body which moves in the plane of the couple. During time dt the body rotates through an angle d(cid:5), and line AB moves to A(cid:4)B(cid:4). We may consider this motion in two parts, ﬁrst a translation to A(cid:4)B(cid:5) and then a rotation d(cid:5) about A(cid:4). We see immediately that during the translation the work done by one of the forces cancels that done by the other force, so that the net work done is dU (cid:2) F(b d(cid:5)) (cid:2) M d(cid:5) due to the rotational part of the motion. If the couple acts in the sense opposite to the rotation, the work done is negative. During a ﬁnite rota- tion, the work done by a couple M whose plane is parallel to the plane of motion is, therefore, U (cid:2) (cid:4) M d(cid:5) F B F b A A′ F B″ θb d B′ θd θd F ≡ M Figure 6/11 c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 460 460 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies mi v i = v v G (a) Translation v i = ri ω mi ri O ω (b) Fixed-Axis Rotation mi yi θ θ i ρ G i ωρ –v –v ω (c) General Plane Motion Figure 6/12 Kinetic Energy We now use the familiar expression for the kinetic energy of a parti- cle to develop expressions for the kinetic energy of a rigid body for each of the three classes of rigid-body plane motion illustrated in Fig. 6/12. (a) Translation. The translating rigid body of Fig. 6/12a has a mass m and all of its particles have a common velocity v. The kinetic en- ergy of any particle of mass mi of the body is Ti (cid:2) so for the en- 1 2 v2Σmi tire body T (cid:2) 1 Σ 2 miv2 1 2 miv2, or (cid:2) T (cid:2) 1 2 mv2 (6/7) This expression holds for both rectilinear and curvilinear translation. (b) Fixed-axis rotation. The rigid body in Fig. 6/12b rotates with an angular velocity (cid:2) about the fixed axis through O. The kinetic energy of a representative particle of mass mi is Ti (cid:2) Thus, 1 2 (cid:2)2Σmiri for the entire body T (cid:2) But the moment of inertia of the body about O is IO (cid:2) Σmiri 2, so 1 2 mi(ri (cid:2))2. 2. v i T (cid:2) 1 2 IO (cid:2)2 (6/8) Note the similarity in the forms of the kinetic energy expressions for translation and rotation. You should verify that the dimensions of the two expressions are identical. v (c) General plane motion. The rigid body in Fig. 6/12c exe- cutes plane motion where, at the instant considered, the velocity of its mass center G is and its angular velocity is (cid:2). The velocity vi of a representative particle of mass mi may be expressed in terms of the mass-center velocity and the velocity (cid:4)i(cid:2) relative to the mass center as shown. With the aid of the law of cosines, we write the kinetic en- ergy of the body as the sum ΣTi of the kinetic energies of all its parti- cles. Thus, v 1 T (cid:2) Σ 2 mivi 2 (cid:2) Σ 1 2 mi(v 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) 2(cid:2)2 (cid:3) 2v(cid:4) i i (cid:2) cos (cid:5)) Because (cid:2) and are common to all terms in the third summation, we may factor them out. Thus, the third term in the expression for T becomes v (cid:2) v Σmi (cid:4) i cos (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:2) v Σmi yi (cid:2) 0 (cid:2) 0. The kinetic energy of the body is then T (cid:2) 2 or i since Σmi yi (cid:2) 1 1 2 (cid:2) 2 v 2Σmi (cid:3) my 2Σmi (cid:4) T (cid:2) 1 2 mv 2 (cid:3) 1 2 I(cid:2)2 (6/9) I where is the moment of inertia of the body about its mass center. This expression for kinetic energy clearly shows the separate contributions to the total kinetic energy resulting from the translational velocity of the mass center and the rotational velocity (cid:2) about the mass center. v c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 461 Article 6/6 Work-Energy Relations 461 The kinetic energy of plane motion may also be expressed in terms of the rotational velocity about the instantaneous center C of zero velocity. Because C momentarily has zero velocity, the proof leading to Eq. 6/8 for the ﬁxed point O holds equally well for point C, so that, alternatively, we may write the kinetic energy of a rigid body in plane motion as T (cid:2) 1 2 IC (cid:2)2 (6/10) In Art. 4/3 we derived Eq. 4/4 for the kinetic energy of any system of mass. We now see that this expression is equivalent to Eq. 6/9 when the mass system is rigid. For a rigid body, the quantity in Eq. 4/4 is the velocity of the representative particle relative to the mass center and is the vector (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)i, which has the magnitude (cid:4)i(cid:2). The 1 2 I(cid:2) (cid:2) 2, summation term in Eq. 4/4 becomes which brings Eq. 4/4 into agreement with Eq. 6/9. 1 2 mi((cid:4) Σmi (cid:4) 1 2 (cid:2)2 (cid:2))2 (cid:4)˙i (cid:2) Σ 2 i i Potential Energy and the Work-Energy Equation Gravitational potential energy Vg and elastic potential energy Ve were covered in detail in Art. 3/7. Recall that the symbol U(cid:4) (rather than U) is used to denote the work done by all forces except the weight and elastic forces, which are accounted for in the potential-energy terms. The work-energy relation, Eq. 3/15a, was introduced in Art. 3/6 for particle motion and was generalized in Art. 4/3 to include the motion of a general system of particles. This equation T1 (cid:3) U1-2 (cid:2) T2 [4/2] applies to any mechanical system. For application to the motion of a sin- gle rigid body, the terms T1 and T2 must include the effects of transla- ton and rotation as given by Eqs. 6/7, 6/8, 6/9, or 6/10, and U1-2 is the work done by all external forces. On the other hand, if we choose to ex- press the effects of weight and springs by means of potential energy rather than work, we may rewrite the above equation as T1 (cid:3) V1 (cid:3) U(cid:4) 1-2 (cid:2) T2 (cid:3) V2 [4/3a] where the prime denotes the work done by all forces other than weight and spring forces. When applied to an interconnected system of rigid bodies, Eq. 4/3a includes the effect of stored elastic energy in the connections, as well as that of gravitational potential energy for the various members. The term includes the work of all forces external to the system (other than gravitational forces), as well as the negative work of internal fric- tion forces, if any. The terms T1 and T2 are the initial and ﬁnal kinetic energies of all moving parts over the interval of motion in question. U(cid:4) 1-2 When the work-energy principle is applied to a single rigid body, ei- ther a free-body diagram or an active-force diagram should be used. In the case of an interconnected system of rigid bodies, an active-force dia- gram of the entire system should be drawn in order to isolate the system and disclose all forces which do work on the system. Diagrams should c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 462 462 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies also be drawn to disclose the initial and ﬁnal positions of the system for the given interval of motion. The work-energy equation provides a direct relationship between the forces which do work and the corresponding changes in the motion of a mechanical system. However, if there is appreciable internal me- chanical friction, then the system must be dismembered in order to dis- close the kinetic-friction forces and account for the negative work which they do. When the system is dismembered, however, one of the primary advantages of the work-energy approach is automatically lost. The work-energy method is most useful for analyzing conservative systems of interconnected bodies, where energy loss due to the negative work of friction forces is negligible. Power The concept of power was discussed in Art. 3/6, which treated work- energy for particle motion. Recall that power is the time rate at which work is performed. For a force F acting on a rigid body in plane motion, the power developed by that force at a given instant is given by Eq. 3/16 and is the rate at which the force is doing work. The power is given by P (cid:2) dU dt (cid:2) F (cid:3) dr dt (cid:2) F (cid:3) v where dr and v are, respectively, the differential displacement and the velocity of the point of application of the force. Similarly, for a couple M acting on the body, the power developed by the couple at a given instant is the rate at which it is doing work, and is given by P (cid:2) dU dt (cid:2) M d(cid:5) dt (cid:2) M(cid:2) where d(cid:5) and (cid:2) are, respectively, the differential angular displacement and the angular velocity of the body. If the senses of M and (cid:2) are the same, the power is positive and energy is supplied to the body. Con- versely, if M and (cid:2) have opposite senses, the power is negative and en- ergy is removed from the body. If the force F and the couple M act simultaneously, the total instantaneous power is P (cid:2) F (cid:3) v (cid:3) M(cid:2) We may also express power by evaluating the rate at which the total me- chanical energy of a rigid body or a system of rigid bodies is changing. The work-energy relation, Eq. 4/3, for an inﬁnitesimal displacement is dU(cid:4) (cid:2) dT (cid:3) dV where dU(cid:4) is the work of the active forces and couples applied to the body or to the system of bodies. Excluded from dU(cid:4) are the work of c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 463 Article 6/6 Work-Energy Relations 463 gravitational forces and that of spring forces, which are accounted for in the dV term. Dividing by dt gives the total power of the active forces and couples as P (cid:2) dU(cid:4) dt (cid:2) T˙ (cid:3) V˙ (cid:2) (T (cid:3) V) d dt Thus, we see that the power developed by the active forces and couples equals the rate of change of the total mechanical energy of the body or system of bodies. We note from Eq. 6/9 that, for a given body, the ﬁrst term may be written T˙ (cid:2) dT dt (cid:2) (cid:5)1 2 d dt mv (cid:3) v (cid:3) I(cid:2)2(cid:6) 1 2 (cid:2) 1 2 m(a (cid:3) v (cid:3) v (cid:3) a) (cid:3) I(cid:2)(cid:2)˙ (cid:2) ma (cid:3) v (cid:3) I(cid:3)((cid:2)) (cid:2) R (cid:3) v (cid:3) M(cid:2) where R is the resultant of all forces acting on the body and is the re- sultant moment about the mass center G of all forces.

The friction force does no work as long as the wheel does not slip. By use of the concept of the instantaneous center C of zero velocity, we see that a point A on the cord to which the 100-N force is applied has a velocity vA (cid:2) [(200 (cid:3) 100)/100]v. Hence, point A on the cord moves a distance of (200 (cid:3) 100)/100 (cid:2) 3 times as far as the center O.

Helpful Hints (cid:2) Since the velocity of the instanta- neous center C on the wheel is zero, it follows that the rate at which the friction force does work is continu- ously zero. Hence, F does no work as long as the wheel does not slip. If the wheel were rolling on a moving platform, however, the friction force would do work, even if the wheel were not slipping. (cid:3) Note that the component of the weight down the plane does negative work.

Determine (a) the angular velocity of the bar as the position (cid:5) (cid:2) 30(cid:2) is passed and (b) the velocity with which B strikes the horizontal surface if the stiffness of the spring is 30 lb/in. Solution. With the friction and mass of the small rollers at A and B neglected, the system may be treated as being conservative. (cid:2) Part (a). For the ﬁrst interval of motion from (cid:5) (cid:2) 0 (state 1) to (cid:5) (cid:2) 30(cid:2) (state 2), the spring is not engaged, so that there is no Ve term in the energy equation. If we adopt the alternative of treating the work of the weight in the Vg term, then there are no other forces which do work, and (cid:2) 0. U(cid:4) 1-2 Since we have a constrained plane motion, there is a kinematic relation be- tween the velocity vB of the center of mass and the angular velocity (cid:2) of the bar. This relation is easily obtained by using the instantaneous center C of zero veloc- ity and noting that vB (cid:2) Thus, the kinetic energy of the bar in the 30(cid:2) posi- tion becomes CB(cid:2).

Each link OB has a mass of 10 kg and may be treated as a slender bar. The 7-kg collar at B slides on the ﬁxed vertical shaft with negligible friction. The spring has a stiffness k (cid:2) 30 kN/m and is con- tacted by the bottom of the collar when the links reach the horizontal position. If the collar is released from rest at the position (cid:5) (cid:2) 45(cid:2) and if friction is sufﬁcient to prevent the wheels from slipping, determine (a) the velocity vB of the collar as it ﬁrst strikes the spring and (b) the maximum deformation x of the spring. vB θ m A 5 m 7 3 O v = vO 150 mm Solution. The mechanism executes plane motion and is conservative with the neglect of kinetic friction losses.

The datum for zero gravita- tional potential energy Vg is conveniently taken through O as shown. (a) For the interval from (cid:5) (cid:2) 45(cid:2) to (cid:5) (cid:2) 0, we note that the initial and ﬁnal ki- netic energies of the wheels are zero since each wheel starts from rest and mo- mentarily comes to rest at (cid:5) (cid:2) 0.

It should be noted that the results of parts (a) and (b) involve a very simple net energy change despite the fact that the mechanism has undergone a fairly complex sequence of motions. Solution of this and similar problems by other than a work-energy approach is not an inviting prospect. Helpful Hint (cid:2) With the work of the weight of the collar B included in the potential- energy terms, there are no other forces external to the system which do work. The friction force acting under each wheel does no work since the wheel does not slip, and, of course, the normal force does no work here. Hence, (cid:2) 0.

We may also modify the equation to determine the conﬁgu- ration of such a system when it undergoes a constant acceleration. Work-Energy Equation for Differential Motions For an inﬁnitesimal interval of motion, Eq. 4/3 becomes dU(cid:4) (cid:2) dT (cid:3) dV The term dU(cid:4) represents the total work done by all active nonpotential forces acting on the system under consideration during the inﬁnitesimal displacement of the system. The work of potential forces is included in the dV-term. If we use the subscript i to denote a representative body of the interconnected system, the differential change in kinetic energy T for the entire system becomes 1 dT (cid:2) d(Σ 2mivi 1 2 (cid:3) Σ 2 Ii (cid:2) i 2) (cid:2) Σmivi dvi (cid:3) ΣIi i d(cid:2) (cid:2) i vi d si mivi d vi where d and d(cid:2)i are the respective changes in the magnitudes of the velocities and where the summation is taken over all bodies of the sys- i d(cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:2) miai i, tem. But for each body, represents the inﬁnitesimal linear displacement of the center where of mass and where d(cid:5)i represents the inﬁnitesimal angular displacement si of the body in the plane of motion. We note that d is identical to (ai)t along the tangent to the curve described by the mass center of the body in question. Also (cid:3)i represents (cid:5)¨i, the angular acceleration of the representative body. Consequently, for the entire system is the component of d where i d(cid:2) (cid:2) i (ai)t and si, ai ai si (cid:2) Ii Ii d (cid:3) (cid:3) dT (cid:2) Σmiai (cid:3) d si (cid:3) ΣIi i d(cid:5) (cid:3) i This change may also be written as dT (cid:2) ΣRi (cid:3) d si (cid:3) ΣMGi (cid:3) d(cid:5) i MGi where Ri and are the resultant force and resultant couple acting on body i and where d(cid:5)i (cid:2) d(cid:5)ik. These last two equations merely show us that the differential change in kinetic energy equals the differential work done on the system by the resultant forces and resultant couples acting on all the bodies of the system. The term dV represents the differential change in the total gravita- tional potential energy Vg and the total elastic potential energy Ve and has the form 1 dV (cid:2) d(Σmighi (cid:3) Σ 2 kj xj 2) (cid:2) Σmig dhi (cid:3) Σkj xj dxj c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 478 478 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies where hi represents the vertical distance of the center of mass of the representative body of mass mi above any convenient datum plane and where xj stands for the deformation, tensile or compressive, of a repre- sentative elastic member of the system (spring) whose stiffness is kj. The complete expression for dU(cid:4) may now be written as dU(cid:4) (cid:2) Σmiai (cid:3) d si (cid:3) ΣIi i d(cid:5) (cid:3) i (cid:3) Σmi g dhi (cid:3) Σkj xj dxj (6/11) i (cid:3) Ii si i d(cid:5) (cid:3) d and When Eq. 6/11 is applied to a system of one degree of freedom, the terms miai will be positive if the accelerations are in the same direction as the respective displacements and negative if they are in the opposite direction. Equation 6/11 has the advantage of relating the accel- erations to the active forces directly, which eliminates the need for dis- membering the system and then eliminating the internal forces and reactive forces by simultaneous solution of the force-mass-acceleration equations for each member. Virtual Work In Eq. 6/11 the differential motions are differential changes in the real or actual displacements which occur. For a mechanical system which assumes a steady-state conﬁguration during constant accelera- tion, we often ﬁnd it convenient to introduce the concept of virtual work. The concepts of virtual work and virtual displacement were intro- duced and used to establish equilibrium conﬁgurations for static sys- tems of interconnected bodies (see Chapter 7 of Vol. 1 Statics). A virtual displacement is any assumed and arbitrary displacement, linear or angular, away from the natural or actual position. For a sys- tem of connected bodies, the virtual displacements must be consistent with the constraints of the system. For example, when one end of a link is hinged about a ﬁxed pivot, the virtual displacement of the other end must be normal to the line joining the two ends. Such requirements for displacements consistent with the constraints are purely kinematic and provide what are known as the equations of constraint. If a set of virtual displacements satisfying the equations of con- straint and therefore consistent with the constraints is assumed for a mechanical system, the proper relationship between the coordinates which specify the conﬁguration of the system will be determined by ap- plying the work-energy relationship of Eq. 6/11, expressed in terms of virtual changes. Thus, (cid:10)U(cid:4) (cid:2) Σmiai (cid:3) (cid:10)si (cid:3) ΣIi i (cid:10)(cid:5) (cid:3) i (cid:3) Σmi g (cid:10)hi (cid:3) Σkj xj (cid:10)xj (6/11a) It is customary to use the differential symbol d to refer to differential changes in the real displacements, whereas the symbol (cid:10) is used to sig- nify virtual changes, that is, differential changes which are assumed rather than real. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 479 Article 6/7 Acceleration from Work-Energy; Virtual Work 479 SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/12 80 N The movable rack A has a mass of 3 kg, and rack B is ﬁxed. The gear has a mass of 2 kg and a radius of gyration of 60 mm. In the position shown, the spring, which has a stiffness of 1.2 kN/m, is stretched a distance of 40 mm. For the instant represented, determine the acceleration a of rack A under the action of the 80-N force. The plane of the ﬁgure is vertical. Solution. The given ﬁgure represents the active-force diagram for the entire system, which is conservative. (cid:2) During an inﬁnitesimal upward displacement dx of rack A, the work dU(cid:4) done on the system is 80 dx, where x is in meters, and this work equals the sum of the corresponding changes in the total energy of the system. These changes, which appear in Eq. 6/11, are as follows: [dT (cid:2) Σmiai (cid:3) dsi (cid:3) ΣIi i d(cid:5) (cid:3) i] dTrack (cid:2) 3a dx dTgear (cid:2) 2 a 2 dx 2 (cid:3) 2(0.06)2 a/2 0.08 dx/2 0.08 (cid:2) 0.781a dx The change in potential energies of the system, from Eq. 6/11, becomes [dV (cid:2) Σmi g dhi (cid:3) Σkj xj dxj] dVrack (cid:2) 3g dx (cid:2) 3(9.81) dx (cid:2) 29.4 dx dVgear (cid:2) 2g(dx/2) (cid:2) g dx (cid:2) 9.81 dx dVspring (cid:2) kj xj dxj (cid:2) 1200(0.04) dx/2 (cid:2) 24 dx (cid:3) (cid:4) Substitution into Eq. 6/11 gives us 80 dx (cid:2) 3a dx (cid:3) 0.781a dx (cid:3) 29.4 dx (cid:3) 9.81 dx (cid:3) 24 dx Canceling dx and solving for a give a (cid:2) 16.76/3.78 (cid:2) 4.43 m/s2 Ans. We see that using the work-energy method for an inﬁnitesimal displace- ment has given us the direct relation between the applied force and the resulting acceleration. It was unnecessary to dismember the system, draw two free-body diagrams, apply ΣF (cid:2) and F (cid:2) kx, eliminate un- wanted terms, and ﬁnally solve for a. twice, apply ΣMG (cid:2) ma I(cid:3) 80 mm A B Helpful Hints (cid:2) Note that none of the remaining forces external to the system do any work. The work done by the weight and by the spring is accounted for in the potential-energy terms. (cid:3) Note that ai for the gear is its mass- center acceleration, which is half that for the rack A. Also, its displace- ment is dx/2. For the rolling gear, the angular acceleration from a (cid:2) r(cid:3) becomes (cid:3)i (cid:2) (a/2)/0.08, and the an- gular displacement from ds (cid:2) r d(cid:5) becomes d(cid:5)i (cid:2) (dx/2)/0.08. (cid:4) Note here that the displacement of the spring is one-half that of the rack. Hence, xi (cid:2) x/2. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 480 480 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/13 A constant force P is applied to end A of the two identical and uniform links and causes them to move to the right in their vertical plane with a horizontal ac- celeration a.

The ﬁgure constitutes the active-force diagram for the system. To ﬁnd the steady-state conﬁguration, consider a virtual displacement of each bar from the natural position assumed during the acceleration. Measurement of the displacement with respect to end A eliminates any work done by force P during the virtual displacement. Thus, (cid:10)U(cid:4) (cid:2) 0 The terms involving acceleration in Eq. 6/11a reduce to ma (cid:3) (cid:10)s (cid:2) ma((cid:4)(cid:10)s1) (cid:3) ma((cid:4)(cid:10)s2) (cid:2) (cid:4)ma (cid:8)(cid:10) (cid:5) l (cid:2) (cid:4)ma (cid:5)l cos (cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:6) sin 2 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:10) (cid:5)3l 2 2 sin (cid:6)(cid:9) (cid:5) 2 We choose the horizontal line through A as the datum for zero potential en- ergy. Thus, the potential energy of the links is Vg (cid:2) 2mg (cid:5)(cid:4) l 2 cos (cid:6) (cid:5) 2 and the virtual change in potential energy becomes (cid:10)Vg (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:5)(cid:4)2mg l 2 cos (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:5) 2 mgl 2 sin (cid:5) 2 (cid:10)(cid:5) Substitution into the work-energy equation for virtual changes, Eq. 6/11a, gives 0 (cid:2) (cid:4)mal cos (cid:5) 2 (cid:10)(cid:5) (cid:3) mgl 2 sin (cid:5) 2 (cid:10)(cid:5) from which (cid:5) (cid:2) 2 tan(cid:4)1 2a g Ans. Again, in this problem we see that the work-energy approach obviated the necessity for dismembering the system, drawing separate free-body diagrams, applying motion equations, eliminating unwanted terms, and solving for (cid:5). Helpful Hints (cid:2) Note that we use the symbol (cid:10) to refer to an assumed or virtual differential change rather than the symbol d, which refers to an inﬁnitesimal change in the real displacement. (cid:3) Here we are evaluating the work done by the resultant forces and couples in the virtual displacement. Note that (cid:3) (cid:2) 0 for both bars. (cid:4) We have chosen to use the angle (cid:5) to describe the conﬁguration of the links, although we could have used the distance between the two ends of the links just as well. (cid:5) The last two terms in Eq. 6/11a ex- press the virtual changes in gravita- tional and elastic potential energy. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 481 PROBLEMS Introductory Problems 6/147 The position of the horizontal platform of mass m0 is controlled by the parallel slender links of masses m and 2m.

In that treatment, we observed that those principles were of particular impor- tance when the applied forces were expressible as functions of the time and when interactions between particles occurred during short periods of time, such as with impact. Similar advantages result when the im- pulse-momentum principles are applied to the motion of rigid bodies. In Art. 4/2 the impulse-momentum principles were extended to cover any deﬁned system of mass particles without restriction as to the connections between the particles of the system. These extended rela- tions all apply to the motion of a rigid body, which is merely a special case of a general system of mass. We will now apply these equations di- rectly to rigid-body motion in two dimensions. Linear Momentum Σmir˙i In Art. 4/4 we deﬁned the linear momentum of a mass system as the vector sum of the linear momenta of all its particles and wrote G (cid:2) Σmivi. With ri representing the position vector to mi, we have vi (cid:2) r˙i and G (cid:2) which, for a system whose total mass is constant, may be written as G (cid:2) d(Σmiri)/dt. When we substitute the principle of mo- (cid:2) Σmiri to locate the mass center, the momentum becomes ments G (cid:2) is the velocity of the mass center. There- fore, as before, we ﬁnd that the linear momentum of any mass system, rigid or nonrigid, is mr d(mr)/dt , where mr˙ (cid:2) r˙ v ρωρ· i = × i · vi = ri mi – r ri – v ρ i · – – v = r G ω O Figure 6/13 G (cid:2) mv [4/5] In the derivation of Eq. 4/5, we note that it was unnecessary to employ the kinematic condition for a rigid body, Fig. 6/13, which is vi (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)i. In that case, we obtain the same result by writing G (cid:2) v Σmi(v vΣmi and the second sum be- comes (cid:2) (cid:2) Σmi(cid:4)i (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) 0 since (cid:4)i is measured from the mass center, making zero. (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)i). The first sum is mv, m(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:4) Next in Art. 4/4 we rewrote Newton’s generalized second law as Eq. 4/6. This equation and its integrated form are ΣF (cid:2) G˙ and G1 (cid:3) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣF dt (cid:2) G2 (6/12) Equation 6/12 may be written in its scalar-component form, which, for plane motion in the x-y plane, gives ΣFx (cid:2) G˙ ΣFy (cid:2) G˙ x y and (Gx)1 (cid:3) (cid:4) t2 (Gy)1 (cid:3) (cid:4) t2 t1 t1 ΣFx dt (cid:2) (Gx)2 (6/12a) ΣFy dt (cid:2) (Gy)2 c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 487 Article 6/8 Impulse-Momentum Equations 487 In words, the ﬁrst of Eqs. 6/12 and 6/12a states that the resultant force equals the time rate of change of momentum. The integrated form of Eqs. 6/12 and 6/12a states that the initial linear momentum plus the lin- ear impulse acting on the body equals the ﬁnal linear momentum. As in the force-mass-acceleration formulation, the force summa- tions in Eqs. 6/12 and 6/12a must include all forces acting externally on the body considered. We emphasize again, therefore, that in the use of the impulse-momentum equations, it is essential to construct the com- plete impulse-momentum diagrams so as to disclose all external im- pulses. In contrast to the method of work and energy, all forces exert impulses, whether they do work or not. Angular Momentum (cid:4)˙i mi (cid:4)˙i, where Angular momentum is deﬁned as the moment of linear momentum. In Art. 4/4 we expressed the angular momentum about the mass center of any prescribed system of mass as HG (cid:2) Σ(cid:4)i (cid:2) mivi, which is merely the vector sum of the moments about G of the linear momenta of all particles. We showed in Art. 4/4 that this vector sum could also be writ- ten as HG (cid:2) Σ(cid:4)i (cid:2) is the velocity of mi with respect to G. Although we have simpliﬁed this expression in Art. 6/2 in the course of deriving the moment equation of motion, we will pursue this same ex- pression again for sake of emphasis by using the rigid body in plane mo- tion represented in Fig. 6/13. The relative velocity becomes (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:4)i, where the angular velocity of the body is (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)k. The unit vector k is di- (cid:4)˙i, and (cid:2) are rected into the paper for the sense of (cid:2) shown.

Thus, we may write HG (cid:2) (cid:4)˙i mi Σmi (cid:4) 2 i Σ(cid:4) 2mi i (cid:4)˙i (cid:4)˙i (cid:2) i Because the angular-momentum vector is always normal to the plane of motion, vector notation is generally unnecessary, and we may write the angular momentum about the mass center as the scalar HG (cid:2) I(cid:2) (6/13) This angular momentum appears in the moment-angular-momentum relation, Eq. 4/9, which in scalar notation for plane motion, along with its integrated form, is ΣMG (cid:2) H˙ G and (HG)1 (cid:3) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣMG dt (cid:2) (HG)2 (6/14) In words, the ﬁrst of Eqs. 6/14 states that the sum of the moments about the mass center of all forces acting on the body equals the time rate of change of angular momentum about the mass center. The inte- grated form of Eq. 6/14 states that the initial angular momentum about the mass center G plus the external angular impulse about G equals the ﬁnal angular momentum about G.

The impulse-momentum diagram (see Art. 3/9) is again essential. See the Sample Problems which accompany this article for examples of these diagrams. _ v _ v _ ω HG = I _ G = m v G d O (a) ω ω _ ω HG = I _ G = m v G _ r O (b) Figure 6/14 With the moments about G of the linear momenta of all particles ac- counted for by HG (cid:2) it follows that we may represent the linear mo- mentum G (cid:2) as a vector through the mass center G, as shown in Fig. 6/14a. Thus, G and HG have vector properties analogous to those of the resultant force and couple. I(cid:2), mv With the establishment of the linear- and angular-momentum re- sultants in Fig. 6/14a, which represents the momentum diagram, the angular momentum HO about any point O is easily written as HO (cid:2) I(cid:2) (cid:3) mvd (6/15) This expression holds at any particular instant of time about O, which may be a ﬁxed or moving point on or off the body. When a body rotates about a ﬁxed point O on the body or body ex- and d (cid:2) may be r 2(cid:2)). (I(cid:2) (cid:3) mr But r(cid:2) tended, as shown in Fig. 6/14b, the relations (cid:2) substituted into the expression for HO, giving HO (cid:2) I (cid:3) mr 2 (cid:2) IO so that v (cid:2) HO (cid:2) IO (6/16) In Art. 4/2 we derived Eq. 4/7, which is the moment-angular- momentum equation about a ﬁxed point O. This equation, written in scalar notation for plane motion along with its integrated form, is ΣMO (cid:2) H˙ O and (HO)1 (cid:3) (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣMO dt (cid:2) (HO)2 (6/17) Note that you should not add linear momentum and angular momentum for the same reason that force and moment cannot be added directly. Interconnected Rigid Bodies The equations of impulse and momentum may also be used for a system of interconnected rigid bodies since the momentum principles are applicable to any general system of constant mass. Figure 6/15 shows the combined free-body diagram and momentum diagram for two G˙ interconnected bodies a and b. Equations 4/6 and 4/7, which are ΣF (cid:2) and ΣMO (cid:2) O where O is a ﬁxed reference point, may be written for each member of the system and added. The sums are H˙ ΣF (cid:2) G˙ ΣMO (cid:2) (H˙ a (cid:3) G˙ O)a b (cid:3) … (cid:3) (H˙ O)b (cid:3) … (6/18) In integrated form for a ﬁnite time interval, these expressions become (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣF dt (cid:2) ((cid:6)G)system (cid:4) t2 t1 ΣMO dt (cid:2) ((cid:6)HO)system (6/19) c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:13 PM Page 489 Article 6/8 Impulse-Momentum Equations 489 F1 _ Ga = mav a _ Gb = mbv b a Ga _ ω (HG)a = I a a F2 F6 Gb _ ω (HG)b = I b b F5 b F4 F3 O Figure 6/15 We note that the equal and opposite actions and reactions in the connec- tions are internal to the system and cancel one another so they are not involved in the force and moment summations. Also, point O is one ﬁxed reference point for the entire system. Conservation of Momentum In Art. 4/5, we expressed the principles of conservation of momen- tum for a general mass system by Eqs. 4/15 and 4/16. These principles are applicable to either a single rigid body or a system of interconnected rigid bodies. Thus, if ΣF (cid:2) 0 for a given interval of time, then G1 (cid:2) G2 [4/15] which says that the linear-momentum vector undergoes no change in the absence of a resultant linear impulse. For the system of interconnected rigid bodies, there may be linear-momentum changes of individual parts of the system during the interval, but there will be no resultant momentum change for the system as a whole if there is no resultant linear impulse. Similarly, if the resultant moment about a given ﬁxed point O or about the mass center is zero during a particular interval of time for a single rigid body or for a system of interconnected rigid bodies, then (HO)1 (cid:2) (HO)2 or (HG)1 (cid:2) (HG)2 [4/16] which says that the angular momentum either about the ﬁxed point or about the mass center undergoes no change in the absence of a corre- sponding resultant angular impulse. Again, in the case of the intercon- nected system, there may be angular-momentum changes of individual components during the interval, but there will be no resultant angular- momentum change for the system as a whole if there is no resultant an- gular impulse about the ﬁxed point or the mass center. Either of Eqs. 4/16 may hold without the other. In the case of an interconnected system, the system center of mass is generally inconvenient to use. As was illustrated previously in Articles 3/9 and 3/10 in the chapter on particle motion, the use of momentum principles greatly facilitates c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:14 PM Page 490 490 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies the analysis of situations where forces and couples act for very short pe- riods of time. Impact of Rigid Bodies Impact phenomena involve a fairly complex interrelationship of en- ergy and momentum transfer, energy dissipation, elastic and plastic de- formation, relative impact velocity, and body geometry. In Art. 3/12 we treated the impact of bodies modeled as particles and considered only the case of central impact, where the contact forces of impact passed through the mass centers of the bodies, as would always happen with colliding smooth spheres, for example. To relate the conditions after im- pact to those before impact required the introduction of the so-called co- efﬁcient of restitution e or impact coefﬁcient, which compares the relative separation velocity with the relative approach velocity mea- sured along the direction of the contact forces. Although in the classical theory of impact, e was considered a constant for given materials, more modern investigations show that e is highly dependent on geometry and impact velocity as well as on materials. At best, even for spheres and rods under direct central and longitudinal impact, the coefﬁcient of restitution is a complex and variable factor of limited use. Any attempt to extend this simpliﬁed theory of impact utilizing a coefﬁcient of restitution for the noncentral impact of rigid bodies of varying shape is a gross oversimpliﬁcation which has little practical value. For this reason, we do not include such an exercise in this book, even though such a theory is easily developed and appears in certain ref- erences. We can and do, however, make full use of the principles of con- servation of linear and angular momentum when they are applicable in discussing impact and other interactions of rigid bodies. 2 0 0 2 , A S A N There are small reaction wheels inside the Hubble Space Telescope that make precision attitude control possible. The principles of angular momen- tum are fundamental to the design and operation of such a control system. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:14 PM Page 491 Article 6/8 Impulse-Momentum Equations 491 SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/14 The force P, which is applied to the cable wrapped around the central hub of the symmetrical wheel, is increased slowly according to P (cid:2) 1.5t, where P is in pounds and t is the time in seconds after P is ﬁrst applied. Determine the angular velocity (cid:2)2 of the wheel 10 seconds after P is applied if the wheel is rolling to the left with a velocity of its center of 3 ft/sec at time t (cid:2) 0. The wheel weighs 120 lb with a radius of gyration about its center of 10 in. and rolls without slipping. Solution. The impulse-momentum diagram of the wheel discloses the initial linear and angular momenta at time t1 (cid:2) 0, all external impulses, and the ﬁnal linear and angular momenta at time t2 (cid:2) 10 sec. The correct direction of the fric- tion force F is that to oppose the slipping which would occur without friction.

We and eliminate F between the two equations by multiplying the second one by adding to the ﬁrst one. Integrating and solving for (cid:2)2 give (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) 3.13 rad/sec clockwise Alternative Solution. We could avoid the necessity of a simultaneous solution by applying the second of Eqs. 6/17 about a ﬁxed point O on the horizontal surface. The moments of the 120-lb weight and the equal and opposite force N cancel one an- other, and F is eliminated since its moment about O is zero. Thus, the angular mo- mentum about O becomes HO (cid:2) (cid:3) where mvr is the centroidal radius of gyration and r is the 18-in. rolling radius.

Helpful Hints (cid:2) Also, we note the clockwise imbal- ance of moments about C, which causes a clockwise angular accelera- tion as the wheel rolls without slip- ping. Since the moment sum about G must also be in the clockwise sense of (cid:3), the friction force must act to the left to provide it. (cid:3) Note carefully the signs of the mo- mentum terms. The ﬁnal linear ve- locity is assumed in the positive x-direction, so is positive. The (Gx)2 initial linear velocity is negative, so (Gx)1 is negative. (cid:4) Since the wheel rolls without slip- ping, a positive x-velocity requires a clockwise angular velocity, and vice versa. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:14 PM Page 492 492 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies SAMPLE PROBLEM 6/15 The sheave E of the hoisting rig shown has a mass of 30 kg and a centroidal radius of gyration of 250 mm.

We noted that a knowledge of kinematics, using both absolute- and relative-motion analysis, is an essential part of the so- lution to problems in rigid-body kinetics. Our approach in Chapter 6 par- alleled Chapter 3, where we developed the kinetics of particles using force-mass-acceleration, work-energy, and impulse-momentum methods. The following is a summary of the important considerations in the solution of rigid-body kinetics problems in plane motion: 1. Identiﬁcation of the body or system. It is essential to make an unambiguous decision as to which body or system of bodies is to be analyzed and then isolate the selected body or system by drawing the free-body and kinetic diagrams, the active-force diagram, or the impulse-momentum diagram, whichever is appropriate. 2. Type of motion. Next identify the category of motion as rectilin- ear translation, curvilinear translation, ﬁxed-axis rotation, or gen- eral plane motion. Always make sure that the kinematics of the problem is properly described before attempting to solve the kinetic equations. 3. Coordinate system. Choose an appropriate coordinate system. The geometry of the particular motion involved is usually the decid- ing factor. Designate the positive sense for moment and force sum- mations and be consistent with the choice. 4. Principle and method. If the instantaneous relationship between the applied forces and the acceleration is desired, then the equiva- lence between the forces and their resultants, as dis- closed by the free-body and kinetic diagrams, will indicate the most direct approach to a solution. and ma I(cid:3) When motion occurs over an interval of displacement, the work- energy approach is indicated, and we relate initial to ﬁnal velocities without calculating the acceleration. We have seen the advantage of this approach for interconnected mechanical systems with negligi- ble internal friction. If the interval of motion is speciﬁed in terms of time rather than displacement, the impulse-momentum approach is indicated. When the angular motion of a rigid body is suddenly changed, the principle of conservation of angular momentum may apply. 5. Assumptions and approximations. By now you should have ac- quired a feel for the practical signiﬁcance of certain assumptions and approximations, such as treating a rod as an ideal slender bar and neglecting friction when it is minimal. These and other ideal- izations are important to the process of obtaining solutions to real problems. c06.qxd 2/10/12 2:14 PM Page 504 504 Chapter 6 Plane Kinetics of Rigid Bodies REVIEW PROBLEMS 6/201 The force P is applied to the homogeneous crate of mass m.

Inclusion of the third dimension adds considerable complexity to the kinematic and kinetic relationships. Not only does the added dimension introduce a third component to vectors which represent force, linear velocity, linear acceleration, and linear momentum, but the introduction of the third dimension also adds the possibility of two additional components for vectors representing angu- lar quantities including moments of forces, angular velocity, angular ac- celeration, and angular momentum. It is in three-dimensional motion that the full power of vector analysis is utilized. A good background in the dynamics of plane motion is extremely useful in the study of three-dimensional dynamics, where the approach to problems and many of the terms are the same as or analogous to those in two dimensions. If the study of three-dimensional dynamics is under- taken without the beneﬁt of prior study of plane-motion dynamics, more 513 c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:28 PM Page 514 514 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies z vA y vB rA rB A rA /B B x Figure 7/1 time will be required to master the principles and to become familiar with the approach to problems. The treatment presented in Chapter 7 is not intended as a complete development of the three-dimensional motion of rigid bodies but merely as a basic introduction to the subject. This introduction should, how- ever, be sufﬁcient to solve many of the more common problems in three- dimensional motion and also to lay the foundation for more advanced study. We will proceed as we did for particle motion and for rigid-body plane motion by ﬁrst examining the necessary kinematics and then pro- ceeding to the kinetics. SECTION A KINEMATICS 7/2 Translation Figure 7/1 shows a rigid body translating in three-dimensional space. Any two points in the body, such as A and B, will move along par- allel straight lines if the motion is one of rectilinear translation or will move along congruent curves if the motion is one of curvilinear transla- tion. In either case, every line in the body, such as AB, remains parallel to its original position. The position vectors and their ﬁrst and second time derivatives are rA (cid:3) rB (cid:2) rA/B vA (cid:3) vB aA (cid:3) aB where rA/B remains constant, and therefore its time derivative is zero. Thus, all points in the body have the same velocity and the same accel- eration. The kinematics of translation presents no special difﬁculty, and further elaboration is unnecessary. 7/3 Fixed-Axis Rotation Consider now the rotation of a rigid body about a ﬁxed axis n-n in space with an angular velocity (cid:2), as shown in Fig. 7/2. The angular ve- locity is a vector in the direction of the rotation axis with a sense estab- lished by the familiar right-hand rule. For ﬁxed-axis rotation, (cid:2) does not change its direction since it lies along the axis. We choose the origin O of the ﬁxed coordinate system on the rotation axis for convenience. Any point such as A which is not on the axis moves in a circular arc in a plane normal to the axis and has a velocity v (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) r (7/1) which may be seen by replacing r by h (cid:2) b and noting that (cid:2) (cid:2) h (cid:3) 0. The acceleration of A is given by the time derivative of Eq. 7/1. Thus, a (cid:3) (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) r (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r) (7/2) c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:28 PM Page 515 Article 7/5 Rotation about a Fixed Point 515 n ω n ⋅ = α ω b A Fixed axis ωv = × r h r an = × ( × r) ω ω ω a A ⋅ ω ωat = × r y n z O n x Figure 7/2 r˙ where has been replaced by its equal, v (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) r.

The reference plane is customarily taken through the mass center G and is called the plane of motion. Because each point in the body, such as A(cid:2), has a motion identical with the motion of the corresponding point (A) in plane P, it follows that the kinematics of plane motion covered in Chap- ter 5 provides a complete description of the motion when applied to the reference plane. 7/5 Rotation about a Fixed Point When a body rotates about a ﬁxed point, the angular-velocity vector no longer remains ﬁxed in direction, and this change calls for a more general concept of rotation. Rotation and Proper Vectors We must ﬁrst examine the conditions under which rotation vectors obey the parallelogram law of addition and may, therefore, be treated as proper vectors. Consider a solid sphere, Fig. 7/4, which is cut from a rigid body conﬁned to rotate about the ﬁxed point O. The x-y-z axes here are taken as ﬁxed in space and do not rotate with the body. In part a of the ﬁgure, two successive 90(cid:2) rotations of the sphere about, ﬁrst, the x-axis and, second, the y-axis result in the mo- tion of a point which is initially on the y-axis in position 1, to positions 2 c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:28 PM Page 516 516 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies z 2 O z 3 O 3 1 x y x 1,2 y θ θ x then y (a) θ θ y then x (b) Figure 7/4 and 3, successively. On the other hand, if the order of the rotations is re- versed, the point undergoes no motion during the y-rotation but moves to point 3 during the 90(cid:2) rotation about the x-axis. Thus, the two cases do not produce the same ﬁnal position, and it is evident from this one special example that ﬁnite rotations do not generally obey the parallelo- gram law of vector addition and are not commutative. Thus, ﬁnite rota- tions may not be treated as proper vectors. Inﬁnitesimal rotations, however, do obey the parallelogram law of vector addition. This fact is shown in Fig. 7/5, which represents the combined effect of two inﬁnitesimal rotations d(cid:3)1 and d(cid:3)2 of a rigid body about the respective axes through the ﬁxed point O. As a result of d(cid:3)1, point A has a displacement d(cid:3)1 (cid:2) r, and likewise d(cid:3)2 causes a displace- ment d(cid:3)2 (cid:2) r of point A. Either order of addition of these inﬁnitesimal displacements clearly produces the same resultant displacement, which is d(cid:3)1 (cid:2) r (cid:2) d(cid:3)2 (cid:2) r (cid:3) (d(cid:3)1 (cid:2) d(cid:3)2) (cid:2) r. Thus, the two rotations are equivalent to the single rotation d(cid:3) (cid:3) d(cid:3)1 (cid:2) d(cid:3)2. It follows that the an- (cid:3)˙ gular velocities (cid:2)1 (cid:3) 1 and (cid:2)2 (cid:3) 2 may be added vectorially to give (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2)1 (cid:2) (cid:2)2. We conclude, therefore, that at any instant of time a body with one ﬁxed point is rotating instantaneously about a particular axis passing through the ﬁxed point. (cid:3)˙ (cid:3)˙ Instantaneous Axis of Rotation To aid in visualizing the concept of the instantaneous axis of rota- tion, we will cite a speciﬁc example. Figure 7/6 represents a solid cylin- drical rotor made of clear plastic containing many black particles embedded in the plastic. The rotor is spinning about its shaft axis at the steady rate (cid:2)1, and its shaft, in turn, is rotating about the ﬁxed vertical axis at the steady rate (cid:2)2, with rotations in the directions indicated. If the rotor is photographed at a certain instant during its motion, the re- sulting picture would show one line of black dots sharply deﬁned, indi- cating that, momentarily, their velocity was zero. This line of points with no velocity establishes the instantaneous position of the axis of ro- tation O-n. Any dot on this line, such as A, would have equal and oppo- site velocity components, v1 due to (cid:2)1 and v2 due to (cid:2)2. All other dots, ⋅ = θ θ ω d θ θ d 1 θ d 2 θ d 2 θ d 1 d θ O θ ×× r d 2 r A d θ × r θ ×× r d 1 Figure 7/5 n ω 1 v2 A v1 ω 2 P O Figure 7/6 c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:28 PM Page 517 Article 7/5 Rotation about a Fixed Point 517 such as the one at P, would appear blurred, and their movements would show as short streaks in the form of small circular arcs in planes normal to the axis O-n. Thus, all particles of the body, except those on line O-n, are momentarily rotating in circular arcs about the instantaneous axis of rotation. If a succession of photographs were taken, we would observe in each photograph that the rotation axis would be deﬁned by a new series of sharply-deﬁned dots and that the axis would change position both in space and relative to the body. For rotation of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point, then, it is seen that the rotation axis is, in general, not a line ﬁxed in the body. Body and Space Cones Relative to the plastic cylinder of Fig. 7/6, the instantaneous axis of rotation O-A-n generates a right-circular cone about the cylinder axis called the body cone. As the two rotations continue and the cylinder swings around the vertical axis, the instantaneous axis of rotation also generates a right-circular cone about the vertical axis called the space cone. These cones are shown in Fig. 7/7 for this particular example. We see that the body cone rolls on the space cone and that the angu- lar velocity (cid:2) of the body is a vector which lies along the common ele- ment of the two cones. For a more general case where the rotations are not steady, the space and body cones are not right-circular cones, Fig. 7/8, but the body cone still rolls on the space cone. Angular Acceleration The angular acceleration (cid:4) of a rigid body in three-dimensional mo- tion is the time derivative of its angular velocity, (cid:4) (cid:3) In contrast to the case of rotation in a single plane where the scalar (cid:3) measures only the change in magnitude of the angular velocity, in three-dimensional motion the vector (cid:4) reﬂects the change in direction of (cid:2) as well as its change in magnitude. Thus in Fig. 7/8 where the tip of the angular ve- locity vector (cid:2) follows the space curve p and changes in both magnitude and direction, the angular acceleration (cid:4) becomes a vector tangent to this curve in the direction of the change in (cid:2). (cid:2)˙. When the magnitude of (cid:2) remains constant, the angular accelera- tion (cid:4) is normal to (cid:2). For this case, if we let (cid:3) stand for the angular ve- locity with which the vector (cid:2) itself rotates (precesses) as it forms the space cone, the angular acceleration may be written (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (7/3) This relation is easily seen from Fig. 7/9. The upper part of the ﬁgure re- lates the velocity of a point A on a rigid body to its position vector from O and the angular velocity of the body. The vectors (cid:4), (cid:2), and (cid:3) in the lower ﬁgure bear exactly the same relationship to each other as do the vectors v, r, and (cid:2) in the upper ﬁgure. If we use Fig. 7/2 to represent a rigid body rotating about a fixed point O with the instantaneous axis of rotation n-n, we see that the n ω Space cone A O Body cone Figure 7/7 ω Body cone Space cone p ⋅ ωα = O Figure 7/8 Rigid cone O A ω r Ω ω v · = r = × r ω ω = constant ⏐ ⏐ r · α = ω ω ΩΩ = × = constant ω ω ω ω ⏐ ⏐ Space cone O Figure 7/9 c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:28 PM Page 518 518 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies velocity v and acceleration a (cid:3) of any point A in the body are given by the same expressions as apply to the case in which the axis is fixed, namely, v˙ v (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) r a (cid:3) (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) r (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r) [7/1] [7/2] (cid:2)˙ The one difference between the case of rotation about a ﬁxed axis and rotation about a ﬁxed point lies in the fact that for rotation about a ﬁxed point, the angular acceleration (cid:4) (cid:3) will have a component nor- mal to (cid:2) due to the change in direction of (cid:2), as well as a component in the direction of (cid:2) to reﬂect any change in the magnitude of (cid:2). Although any point on the rotation axis n-n momentarily will have zero velocity, it will not have zero acceleration as long as (cid:2) is changing its direction. On the other hand, for rotation about a ﬁxed axis, (cid:4) (cid:3) has only the one component along the ﬁxed axis to reﬂect the change in the magnitude of (cid:2). Furthermore, points which lie on the ﬁxed rotation axis clearly have no velocity or acceleration. (cid:2)˙ Although the development in this article is for the case of rotation about a ﬁxed point, we observe that rotation is a function solely of angu- lar change, so that the expressions for (cid:2) and (cid:4) do not depend on the ﬁx- ity of the point around which rotation occurs. Thus, rotation may take place independently of the linear motion of the rotation point. This con- clusion is the three-dimensional counterpart of the concept of rotation of a rigid body in plane motion described in Art. 5/2 and used through- out Chapters 5 and 6.

We have applied these principles to problems in plane motion and now extend them to space motion. We will make use of both translating axes and rotating reference axes. Translating Reference Axes Figure 7/10 shows a rigid body which has an angular velocity (cid:2). We may choose any convenient point B as the origin of a translating refer- ence system x-y-z. The velocity v and acceleration a of any other point A in the body are given by the relative-velocity and relative-acceleration expressions vA (cid:3) vB (cid:2) vA/B aA (cid:3) aB (cid:2) aA/B O [5/4] [5/7] which were developed in Arts. 5/4 and 5/6 for the plane motion of rigid bodies. These expressions also hold in three dimensions, where the three vectors for each of the equations are also coplanar. In applying these relations to rigid-body motion in space, we note from Fig. 7/10 that the distance remains constant. Thus, from an ob- server’s position on x-y-z, the body appears to rotate about the point B and point A appears to lie on a spherical surface with B as the center. Consequently, we may view the general motion as a translation of the body with the motion of B plus a rotation of the body about B. AB The relative-motion terms represent the effect of the rotation about B and are identical to the velocity and acceleration expressions dis- cussed in the previous article for rotation of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point. Therefore, the relative-velocity and relative-acceleration equa- tions may be written vA (cid:3) vB (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) rA/B aA (cid:3) aB (cid:2) (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) rA/B (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) rA/B) (7/4) where (cid:2) and are the instantaneous angular velocity and angular accel- eration of the body, respectively. (cid:2)˙ The selection of the reference point B is quite arbitrary in theory. In practice, point B is chosen for convenience as some point in the body whose motion is known in whole or in part. If point A is chosen as the reference point, the relative-motion equations become vB (cid:3) vA (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) rB/A aB (cid:3) aA (cid:2) (cid:2)˙ (cid:2) rB/A (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) rB/A) I S B R O C / r a g u S m J © i where rB/A (cid:3) (cid:4)rA/B. It should be clear that (cid:2) and, thus, are the same vectors for either formulation since the absolute angular motion of the body is independent of the choice of reference point.

If points A and B in Fig. 7/10 represent the ends of a rigid control link in a spatial mechanism where the end connections act as ball-and- socket joints (as in Sample Problem 7/3), it is necessary to impose cer- tain kinematic requirements. Clearly, any rotation of the link about its own axis AB does not affect the action of the link. Thus, the angular ve- locity (cid:2)n whose vector is normal to the link describes its action. It is nec- essary, therefore, that (cid:2)n and rA/B be at right angles, and this condition is satisﬁed if (cid:3) 0. (cid:2) n (cid:3) rA/B Similarly, it is only the component (cid:4)n* of the angular acceleration of (cid:3) 0 must the link normal to AB which affects its action, so that also hold.

The description of Fig. 7/10 is modiﬁed in Fig. 7/11 to show reference axes whose origin is attached to the reference point B as before, but which rotate with an absolute angular velocity (cid:3) which may be different from the absolute angular velocity (cid:2) of the body. We now make use of Eqs. 5/11, 5/12, 5/13, and 5/14 developed in Art. 5/7 for describing the plane motion of a rigid body with the use of rotat- ing axes. The extension of these relations from two to three dimensions is easily accomplished by merely including the z-component of the vec- tors, and this step is left to the student to carry out. Replacing (cid:2) in these equations by the angular velocity (cid:3) of our rotating x-y-z axes gives us i˙ (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) i j˙ (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) j k˙ (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) k (7/5) for the time derivatives of the rotating unit vectors attached to x-y-z.

We observe *It may be shown that (cid:4)n (cid:3) if the angular velocity of the link about its own axis is not changing.

The moment equation for three-dimensional motion, however, is not nearly as simple as the third of Eqs. 6/1 for plane motion since the change of angular momen- tum has a number of additional components which are absent in plane motion. z ω y – v x y ω mi ρ i G (a) Y X Z z Z mi ri O Y x X (b) Figure 7/12 We now consider a rigid body moving with any general motion in space, Fig. 7/12a. Axes x-y-z are attached to the body with origin at the mass center G. Thus, the angular velocity (cid:2) of the body becomes the an- gular velocity of the x-y-z axes as observed from the ﬁxed reference axes X-Y-Z. The absolute angular momentum HG of the body about its mass center G is the sum of the moments about G of the linear momenta of all elements of the body and was expressed in Art. 4/4 as HG (cid:3) Σ((cid:5)i (cid:2) mivi), where vi is the absolute velocity of the mass element mi. But for the rigid body, vi (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:5)i, where (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:5)i is the relative velocity of mi with respect to G as seen from nonrotating axes. Thus, we may write v HG (cid:3) (cid:4)v (cid:2) Σmi (cid:5) i (cid:2) Σ[ (cid:5) i (cid:2) mi((cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:5) i)] v where we have factored out from the ﬁrst summation terms by revers- ing the order of the cross product and changing the sign. With the origin (cid:3) 0. at the mass center G, the ﬁrst term in HG is zero since Σmi (cid:5)i (cid:3) The second term with the substitution of dm for mi and (cid:5) for (cid:5)i gives HG (cid:3) (cid:6) [(cid:5) (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:5))] dm (7/8) m(cid:5) Before expanding the integrand of Eq. 7/8, we consider also the case of a rigid body rotating about a ﬁxed point O, Fig. 7/12b. The x-y-z axes are attached to the body, and both body and axes have an angular veloc- ity (cid:2). The angular momentum about O was expressed in Art. 4/4 and is HO (cid:3) Σ(ri (cid:2) mivi), where, for the rigid body, vi (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) ri. Thus, with the substitution of dm for mi and r for ri, the angular momentum is HO (cid:3) (cid:6) [r (cid:2) ((cid:2) (cid:2) r)] dm (7/9) Moments and Products of Inertia We observe now that for the two cases of Figs. 7/12a and 7/12b, the position vectors (cid:5)i and ri are given by the same expression xi (cid:2) yj (cid:2) zk. Thus, Eqs. 7/8 and 7/9 are identical in form, and the symbol H will be used here for either case. We now carry out the expansion of the inte- grand in the two expressions for angular momentum, recognizing that the components of (cid:2) are invariant with respect to the integrals over the body and thus become constant multipliers of the integrals.

These quantities describe the man- ner in which the mass of a rigid body is distributed with respect to the chosen axes. The calculation of moments and products of inertia is ex- plained fully in Appendix B. The double subscripts for the moments and products of inertia preserve a symmetry of notation which has special meaning in their description by tensor notation.* Observe that Ixy (cid:3) Iyx, Ixz (cid:3) Izx, and Iyz (cid:3) Izy.

Remember that in each of the two cases represented, the reference axes x-y-z are attached to the rigid body. This attachment makes the *See, for example, the ﬁrst author’s Dynamics, 2nd Edition, SI Version, 1975, John Wiley & Sons, Art. 41. c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 541 Article 7/7 Angular Momentum 541 moment-of-inertia integrals and the product-of-inertia integrals of Eqs. 7/10 invariant with time. If the x-y-z axes were to rotate with respect to an irregular body, then these inertia integrals would be functions of the time, which would introduce an undesirable complexity into the angular- momentum relations. An important exception occurs when a rigid body is spinning about an axis of symmetry, in which case, the inertia inte- grals are not affected by the angular position of the body about its spin axis. Thus, for a body rotating about an axis of symmetry, it is frequently convenient to choose one axis of the reference system to coincide with the axis of rotation and allow the other two axes not to turn with the body. In addition to the momentum components due to the angular ve- locity (cid:3) of the reference axes, then, an added angular-momentum com- ponent along the spin axis due to the relative spin about the axis would have to be accounted for. Principal Axes The array of moments and products of inertia which appear in Eq. 7/12 is called the inertia matrix or inertia tensor. As we change the orientation of the axes relative to the body, the moments and products of inertia will also change in value. It can be shown* that there is one unique orientation of axes x-y-z for a given origin for which the products of inertia vanish and the moments of inertia Ixx, Iyy, Izz take on stationary values. For this orientation, the inertia matrix takes the form and is said to be diagonalized. The axes x-y-z for which the products of inertia vanish are called the principal axes of inertia, and Ixx, Iyy, and Izz are called the principal moments of inertia. The principal moments of inertia for a given origin represent the maximum, the minimum, and an intermediate value of the moments of inertia. If the coordinate axes coincide with the principal axes of inertia, Eq. 7/11 for the angular momentum about the mass center or about a ﬁxed point becomes H (cid:3) Ixx y j (cid:2) Izz (cid:2) xi (cid:2) Iyy (cid:2) (cid:2) zk (7/13) It is always possible to locate the principal axes of inertia for a gen- eral three-dimensional rigid body. Thus, we can express its angular mo- mentum by Eq. 7/13, although it may not always be convenient to do so *See, for example, the ﬁrst author’s Dynamics, 2nd Edition, SI Version, 1975, John Wiley & Sons, Art. 41. c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 542 542 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies for geometric reasons. Except when the body rotates about one of the principal axes of inertia or when Ixx (cid:3) Iyy (cid:3) Izz, the vectors H and (cid:2) have different directions. Transfer Principle for Angular Momentum The momentum properties of a rigid body may be represented by the resultant linear-momentum vector G (cid:3) through the mass center and the resultant angular-momentum vector HG about the mass center, as shown in Fig. 7/13. Although HG has the properties of a free vector, we represent it through G for convenience. mv These vectors have properties analogous to those of a force and a couple. Thus, the angular momentum about any point P equals the free vector HG plus the moment of the linear-momentum vector G about P. Therefore, we may write HP (cid:3) HG (cid:2) r (cid:2) G (7/14) G r HG G = mv P Figure 7/13 This relation, which was derived previously in Chapter 4 as Eq. 4/10, also applies to a ﬁxed point O on the body or body extended, where O merely replaces P.

Momentum Equations In Art. 4/4 of Chapter 4, we established the general linear- and angular-momentum equations for a system of constant mass. These equations are ΣF (cid:2) G˙ ΣM (cid:2) H˙ [4/6] [4/7] or [4/9] H˙ , The general moment relation, Eq. 4/7 or 4/9, is expressed here by the single equation ΣM (cid:2) where the terms are taken either about a ﬁxed point O or about the mass center G. In the derivation of the moment principle, the derivative of H was taken with respect to an absolute co- ordinate system. When H is expressed in terms of components measured relative to a moving coordinate system x-y-z which has an angular veloc- ity (cid:2), then by Eq. 7/7 the moment relation becomes (cid:3) ΣM (cid:2) (cid:2)dH dt xi (cid:4) H˙ (cid:2) (H˙ xyz (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3) H y j (cid:4) H˙ zk) (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3) H The terms in parentheses represent that part of due to the change in magnitude of the components of H, and the cross-product term repre- sents that part due to the changes in direction of the components of H. Expansion of the cross product and rearrangement of terms give H˙ ΣM (cid:2) (H˙ (cid:4) (H˙ (cid:4) (H˙ x (cid:5) Hy y (cid:5) Hz z (cid:5) Hx (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3) z (cid:4) Hz x (cid:4) Hx y (cid:4) Hy (cid:3) y)i (cid:3) x)k (cid:3) z)j (7/19) Equation 7/19 is the most general form of the moment equation about a ﬁxed point O or about the mass center G. The (cid:3)’s are the angu- lar velocity components of rotation of the reference axes, and the H- components in the case of a rigid body are as deﬁned in Eq. 7/12, where the (cid:2)’s are the components of the angular velocity of the body. We now apply Eq. 7/19 to a rigid body where the coordinate axes are attached to the body. Under these conditions, when expressed in the x-y-z coordinates, the moments and products of inertia are invariant with time, c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 551 Article 7/9 Momentum and Energy Equations of Motion 551 and (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2). Thus, for axes attached to the body, the three scalar compo- nents of Eq. 7/19 become ΣMx (cid:3) H˙ ΣMy (cid:3) H˙ ΣMz (cid:3) H˙ y (cid:2) z (cid:2) Hz (cid:2) x (cid:4) Hy x (cid:2) Hx y (cid:4) Hz (cid:2) z (cid:4) Hx (cid:2) (cid:2) y (cid:2) Hy x (cid:2) z (7/20) Equations 7/20 are the general moment equations for rigid-body motion with axes attached to the body. They hold with respect to axes through a ﬁxed point O or through the mass center G. KEY CONCEPTS In Art. 7/7 it was mentioned that, in general, for any origin ﬁxed to a rigid body, there are three principal axes of inertia with respect to which the products of inertia vanish. If the reference axes coincide with the principal axes of inertia with origin at the mass center G or at a point O ﬁxed to the body and ﬁxed in space, the factors Ixy, Iyz, Ixz will be zero, and Eqs. 7/20 become ΣMx (cid:3) Ixx ΣMy (cid:3) Iyy ΣMz (cid:3) Izz (cid:2)˙x (cid:4) (Iyy (cid:4) Izz)(cid:2) (cid:2)˙y (cid:4) (Izz (cid:4) Ixx)(cid:2) z (cid:2)˙z (cid:4) (Ixx (cid:4) Iyy)(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) y (cid:2) x x y z (7/21) These relations, known as Euler’s equations,* are extremely useful in the study of rigid-body motion. Energy Equations The resultant of all external forces acting on a rigid body may be re- placed by the resultant force ΣF acting through the mass center and a resultant couple ΣMG acting about the mass center. Work is done by the ΣF (cid:3) v resultant force and the resultant couple at the respective rates is the linear velocity of the mass center and (cid:2) is and the angular velocity of the body. Integration over the time from condi- tion 1 to condition 2 gives the total work done during the time interval. Equating the works done to the respective changes in kinetic energy as expressed in Eq. 7/15 gives where ΣMG (cid:3) (cid:2), v (7/22) These equations express the change in translational kinetic energy and the change in rotational kinetic energy, respectively, for the interval during which ΣF or ΣMG acts, and the sum of the two expressions equals (cid:6)T. *Named after Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), a Swiss mathematician. c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 552 552 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies The work-energy relationship, developed in Chapter 4 for a general system of particles and given by U(cid:2) 1-2 (cid:3) (cid:6)T (cid:2) (cid:6)V [4/3] was used in Chapter 6 for rigid bodies in plane motion. The equation is equally applicable to rigid-body motion in three dimensions. As we have seen previously, the work-energy approach is of great advantage when we analyze the initial and final end-point conditions of motion. Here the work done during the interval by all active forces exter- nal to the body or system is equated to the sum of the corresponding changes in kinetic energy (cid:6)T and potential energy (cid:6)V. The potential- energy change is determined in the usual way, as described previously in Art. 3/7. U(cid:2) 1-2 We will limit our application of the equations developed in this arti- cle to two problems of special interest, parallel-plane motion and gyro- scopic motion, discussed in the next two articles. 7/10 Parallel-Plane Motion When all particles of a rigid body move in planes which are parallel to a ﬁxed plane, the body has a general form of plane motion, as de- scribed in Art. 7/4 and pictured in Fig. 7/3. Every line in such a body which is normal to the ﬁxed plane remains parallel to itself at all times. We take the mass center G as the origin of coordinates x-y-z which are attached to the body, with the x-y plane coinciding with the plane of mo- tion P. The components of the angular velocity of both the body and the attached axes become (cid:2)x (cid:3) (cid:2)y (cid:3) 0, (cid:2)z (cid:3) 0. For this case, the angular- momentum components from Eq. 7/12 become Hx (cid:3) (cid:4)Ixz (cid:2) z Hy (cid:3) (cid:4)Iyz (cid:2) z Hz (cid:3) Izz (cid:2) z and the moment relations of Eqs. 7/20 reduce to (cid:2)˙z (cid:2) Iyz (cid:2)˙z (cid:4) Ixz ΣMx (cid:3) (cid:4)Ixz ΣMy (cid:3) (cid:4)Iyz ΣMz (cid:3) Izz (cid:2)˙z 2 (cid:2) z 2 (cid:2) z (7/23) We see that the third moment equation is equivalent to the second of Eqs. 6/1, where the z-axis passes through the mass center, or to Eq. 6/4 if the z-axis passes through a ﬁxed point O. Equations 7/23 hold for an origin of coordinates at the mass center, as shown in Fig. 7/3, or for any origin on a ﬁxed axis of rotation. The three independent force equations of motion which also apply to parallel- plane motion are clearly ΣFx (cid:3) max ΣFy (cid:3) may ΣFz (cid:3) 0 Equations 7/23 ﬁnd special use in describing the effect of dynamic imbalance in rotating machinery and in rolling bodies. c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 553 Article 7/10 Parallel-Plane Motion 553 SAMPLE PROBLEM 7/7 The two circular disks, each of mass m1, are connected by the curved bar bent into quarter-circular arcs and welded to the disks. The bar has a mass m2. The total mass of the assembly is m (cid:3) 2m1 (cid:2) m2. If the disks roll without slip- ping on a horizontal plane with a constant velocity v of the disk centers, deter- mine the value of the friction force under each disk at the instant represented when the plane of the curved bar is horizontal. r r y G r x z r A v B Solution. The motion is identiﬁed as parallel-plane motion since the planes of motion of all parts of the system are parallel.

This motion occurs whenever the axis about which a body is spinning is itself rotating about another axis. Although the com- plete description of this motion involves considerable complexity, the most common and useful examples of gyroscopic motion occur when the axis of a rotor spinning at constant speed turns (precesses) about an- other axis at a steady rate. Our discussion in this article will focus on this special case. The gyroscope has important engineering applications. With a mounting in gimbal rings (see Fig. 7/19b), the gyro is free from external moments, and its axis will retain a ﬁxed direction in space regardless of the rotation of the structure to which it is attached. In this way, the gyro is used for inertial guidance systems and other directional control devices. With the addition of a pendulous mass to the inner gimbal ring, the earth’s rotation causes the gyro to precess so that the spin axis will always point north, and this action forms the basis of the gyro compass. The gyroscope has also found important use as a stabilizing device. The controlled precession of a large gyro mounted in a ship is used to pro- duce a gyroscopic moment to counteract the rolling of a ship at sea. The gyroscopic effect is also an extremely important consideration in the de- sign of bearings for the shafts of rotors which are subjected to forced precessions. We will ﬁrst describe gyroscopic action with a simple physical ap- proach which relies on our previous experience with the vector changes encountered in particle kinetics. This approach will help us gain a direct physical insight into gyroscopic action. Next, we will make use of the general momentum relation, Eq. 7/19, for a more complete description. y Precession axis ⏐ ⏐ = · ψ F Spin axis z p M Torque axis Figure 7/14 Simpliﬁed Approach Figure 7/14 shows a symmetrical rotor spinning about the z-axis with a large angular velocity p, known as the spin velocity. If we apply two forces F to the rotor axle to form a couple M whose vector is di- rected along the x-axis, we will ﬁnd that the rotor shaft rotates in the x- z plane about the y-axis in the sense indicated, with a relatively slow angular velocity (cid:5) (cid:3) known as the precession velocity. Thus, we iden- tify the spin axis (p), the torque axis (M), and the precession axis ((cid:3)), where the usual right-hand rule identiﬁes the sense of the rotation vec- tors. The rotor shaft does not turn about the x-axis in the sense of M, as it would if the rotor were not spinning. To aid understanding of this phenomenon, a direct analogy may be made between the rotation vec- tors and the familiar vectors which describe the curvilinear motion of a particle. (cid:11)˙ Figure 7/15a shows a particle of mass m moving in the x-z plane with constant speed (cid:2)v(cid:2) (cid:3) v. The application of a force F normal to its linear momentum G (cid:3) mv causes a change dG (cid:3) d(mv) in its momentum. We see that dG, and thus dv, is a vector in the direction of the normal force F according to Newton’s second law F (cid:3) which may be written as G˙ , ψ F x Ω c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 559 Article 7/11 Gyroscopic Motion: Steady Precession 559 F dt (cid:3) dG. From Fig. 7/15b we see that, in the limit, tan d(cid:7) (cid:3) d(cid:7) (cid:3) F dt/mv or F (cid:3) In vector notation with (cid:2) (cid:3) the force becomes mv (cid:7)˙. (cid:7)˙j, F (cid:3) m(cid:2) (cid:2) v which is the vector equivalent of our familiar scalar relation Fn (cid:3) man for the normal force on the particle, as treated extensively in Chapter 3. With these relations in mind, we now turn to our problem of rota- tion. Recall now the analogous equation M (cid:3) which we developed for any prescribed mass system, rigid or nonrigid, referred to its mass cen- ter (Eq. 4/9) or to a ﬁxed point O (Eq. 4/7). We now apply this relation to our symmetrical rotor, as shown in Fig. 7/15c. For a high rate of spin p and a low precession rate (cid:3) about the y-axis, the angular momentum is represented by the vector H (cid:3) Ip, where I (cid:3) Izz is the moment of inertia of the rotor about the spin axis. H˙ H˙ , Initially, we neglect the small component of angular momentum about the y-axis which accompanies the slow precession. The application of the couple M normal to H causes a change dH (cid:3) d(Ip) in the angular momentum. We see that dH, and thus dp, is a vector in the direction of which may also be written M dt (cid:3) dH. Just the couple M since M (cid:3) as the change in the linear-momentum vector of the particle is in the di- rection of the applied force, so is the change in the angular-momentum vector of the gyro in the direction of the couple. Thus, we see that the vectors M, H, and dH are analogous to the vectors F, G, and dG. With this insight, it is no longer strange to see the rotation vector undergo a change which is in the direction of M, thereby causing the axis of the rotor to precess about the y-axis. In Fig. 7/15d we see that during time dt the angular-momentum vector Ip has swung through the angle d(cid:11), so that in the limit with tan d(cid:11) (cid:3) d(cid:11), we have G = mv z F · (F = G) (a) y y mv dθ z (b) y M dG = d(mv) x ω ·θ = j F dt = d(mv) x H = Ip z · (M = H) dH = d(Ip) (c) y x ψ= · j M dt = d(Ip) x d(cid:11) (cid:3) M dt Ip or M (cid:3) I d(cid:11) dt p dψ Ip z Substituting (cid:5) (cid:3) d(cid:11)/dt for the magnitude of the precession velocity gives us (d) Figure 7/15 M (cid:3) I(cid:5)p (7/24) We note that M, (cid:3), and p as vectors are mutually perpendicular, and that their vector relationship may be represented by writing the equa- tion in the cross-product form M (cid:3) I(cid:3) (cid:2) p (7/24a) which is completely analogous to the foregoing relation F (cid:3) m(cid:2) (cid:2) v for the curvilinear motion of a particle as developed from Figs. 7/15a and b.

The correct spatial relationship among the three vectors may be re- membered from the fact that dH, and thus dp, is in the direction of M, which establishes the correct sense for the precession (cid:3). Therefore, the spin vector p always tends to rotate toward the torque vector M. Figure 7/16 represents three orientations of the three vectors which are consis- tent with their correct order. Unless we establish this order correctly in a given problem, we are likely to arrive at a conclusion directly opposite to the correct one. Remember that Eq. 7/24, like F (cid:3) ma and M (cid:3) I(cid:3), is an equation of motion, so that the couple M represents the couple due to all forces acting on the rotor, as disclosed by a correct free-body diagram of the rotor. Also note that, when a rotor is forced to precess, as occurs with the turbine in a ship which is executing a turn, the motion will generate a gyroscopic couple M which obeys Eq. 7/24a in both magni- tude and sense. In the foregoing discussion of gyroscopic motion, it was assumed that the spin was large and the precession was small. Although we can see from Eq. 7/24 that for given values of I and M, the precession (cid:5) must be small if p is large, let us now examine the inﬂuence of (cid:5) on the momentum relations. Again, we restrict our attention to steady preces- sion, where (cid:3) has a constant magnitude. Figure 7/17 shows our same rotor again. Because it has a moment of inertia about the y-axis and an angular velocity of precession about this axis, there will be an additional component of angular momentum about the y-axis. Thus, we have the two components Hz (cid:3) Ip and Hy (cid:3) I0(cid:5), where I0 stands for Iyy and, again, I stands for Izz. The total angular mo- mentum is H as shown. The change in H remains dH (cid:3) M dt as previ- ously, and the precession during time dt is the angle d(cid:11) (cid:3) M dt/Hz (cid:3) M dt/(Ip) as before. Thus, Eq. 7/24 is still valid and for steady precession is an exact description of the motion as long as the spin axis is perpen- dicular to the axis around which precession occurs. Consider now the steady precession of a symmetrical top, Fig. 7/18, spinning about its axis with a high angular velocity p and sup- ported at its point O. Here the spin axis makes an angle (cid:7) with the vertical Z-axis around which precession occurs. Again, we will neglect the small angular-momentum component due to the precession and consider H equal to Ip, the angular momentum about the axis of the top associated with the spin only. The moment about O is due to the weight and is is the distance from O to the mass center G. From the diagram, we see that the angular-momentum vec- tor HO has a change dHO (cid:3) MO dt in the direction of MO during time dt and that (cid:7) is unchanged. The increment in precessional angle around the Z-axis is sin (cid:7), where mgr r d(cid:11) (cid:3) MO dt Ip sin (cid:7) Substituting the values MO (cid:3) mgr sin (cid:7) and (cid:5) (cid:3) d(cid:11)/dt gives Figure 7/18 mgr sin (cid:7) (cid:3) I(cid:5)p sin (cid:7) or mgr (cid:3) I(cid:5)p Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 561 Article 7/11 Gyroscopic Motion: Steady Precession 561 which is independent of (cid:7). Introducing the radius of gyration so that I (cid:3) mk2 and solving for the precessional velocity give (cid:5) (cid:3) gr k2p (7/25) Unlike Eq. 7/24, which is an exact description for the rotor of Fig. 7/17 with precession conﬁned to the x-z plane, Eq. 7/25 is an approxima- tion based on the assumption that the angular momentum associated with (cid:5) is negligible compared with that associated with p. We will see the amount of the error associated with this approximation when we re- consider steady-state precession later in this article. On the basis of our analysis, the top will have a steady precession at the constant angle (cid:7) only if it is set in motion with a value of (cid:5) which satisﬁes Eq. 7/25. When these conditions are not met, the precession becomes unsteady, and (cid:7) may oscillate with an amplitude which increases as the spin veloc- ity decreases. The corresponding rise and fall of the rotation axis is called nutation. More Detailed Analysis We now make direct use of Eq. 7/19, which is the general angular- momentum equation for a rigid body, by applying it to a body spinning about its axis of rotational symmetry. This equation is valid for rotation about a ﬁxed point or for rotation about the mass center. A spinning top, the rotor of a gyroscope, and a spacecraft are examples of bodies whose motions can be described by the equations for rotation about a point. The general moment equations for this class of problems are fairly complex, and their complete solutions involve the use of elliptic in- tegrals and somewhat lengthy computations. However, a large fraction of engineering problems where the motion is one of rotation about a point involves the steady precession of bodies of revolution which are spinning about their axes of symmetry. These conditions greatly sim- plify the equations and thus facilitate their solution. Consider a body with axial symmetry, Fig. 7/19a, rotating about a ﬁxed point O on its axis, which is taken to be the z-direction. With O as origin, the x- and y-axes automatically become principal axes of inertia along with the z-axis. This same description may be used for the rota- tion of a similar symmetrical body about its center of mass G, which is taken as the origin of coordinates as shown with the gimbaled gyroscope rotor of Fig. 7/19b. Again, the x- and y-axes are principal axes of inertia for point G. The same description may also be used to represent the ro- tation about the mass center of an axially symmetric body in space, such as the spacecraft in Fig. 7/19c. In each case, we note that, regardless of the rotation of the axes or of the body relative to the axes (spin about the z-axis), the moments of inertia about the x- and y-axes remain con- stant with time. The principal moments of inertia are again designated Izz (cid:3) I and Ixx (cid:3) Iyy (cid:3) I0. The products of inertia are, of course, zero. Before applying Eq. 7/19, we introduce a set of coordinates which provide a natural description for our problem. These coordinates are z O (a) z θ y x y G x (b) z y G x (c) Figure 7/19 c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 562 562 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies shown in Fig. 7/20 for the example of rotation about a ﬁxed point O. The axes X-Y-Z are ﬁxed in space, and plane A contains the X-Y axes and the ﬁxed point O on the rotor axis. Plane B contains point O and is always normal to the rotor axis. Angle (cid:7) measures the inclination of the rotor axis from the vertical Z-axis and is also a measure of the angle between planes A and B. The intersection of the two planes is the x-axis, which is located by the angle (cid:11) from the X-axis. The y-axis lies in plane B, and the z-axis coincides with the rotor axis. The angles (cid:7) and (cid:11) completely specify the position of the rotor axis. The angular displacement of the rotor with respect to axes x-y-z is speciﬁed by the angle (cid:10) measured from the x-axis to the x(cid:2)-axis, which is attached to the rotor. The spin velocity becomes p (cid:3) (cid:10)˙. z ΣMz · ψ θ z = cos z = Ω ω z + p · φ where p = Z θ y ΣMy ω ψ θ y = y = sin · A X · φ O φ ψ B x′ Y ω θ· x = x = ΣMx x Figure 7/20 The components of the angular velocity (cid:2) of the rotor and the angu- lar velocity (cid:3) of the axes x-y-z from Fig. 7/20 become (cid:5) x (cid:3) (cid:7)˙ y (cid:3) (cid:11)˙ sin (cid:7) (cid:5) z (cid:3) (cid:11)˙ cos (cid:7) (cid:5) (cid:2) x (cid:3) (cid:7)˙ y (cid:3) (cid:11)˙ sin (cid:7) (cid:2) z (cid:3) (cid:11)˙ cos (cid:7) (cid:2) p (cid:2) It is important to note that the axes and the body have identical x- and y-components of angular velocity, but that the z-components differ by the relative angular velocity p.

In a given prob- lem, the solution to the equations will depend on the moment sums ap- plied to the body about the three coordinate axes. We will conﬁne our use of these equations to two particular cases of rotation about a point which are described in the following sections. Steady-State Precession We now examine the conditions under which the rotor precesses at a steady rate at a constant angle (cid:7) and with constant spin velocity p. Thus, (cid:11)˙ (cid:11)˙ (cid:3) constant, (cid:7) (cid:3) constant, (cid:11)¨ (cid:3) 0 (cid:7)˙ (cid:3) (cid:7)¨ (cid:3) 0 p (cid:3) constant, p˙ (cid:3) 0 and Eqs. 7/26 become ΣMx (cid:3) (cid:11)˙ sin (cid:7)[I((cid:11)˙ cos (cid:7) (cid:2) p) (cid:4) I0 ΣMy (cid:3) 0 ΣMz (cid:3) 0 (cid:11)˙ cos (cid:7)] (7/27) From these results, we see that the required moment acting on the rotor about O (or about G) must be in the x-direction since the y- and (cid:11)˙, z-components are zero. Furthermore, with the constant values of (cid:7), and p, the moment is constant in magnitude. It is also important to note that the moment axis is perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the pre- cession axis (Z-axis) and the spin axis (z-axis). We may also obtain Eqs. 7/27 by recognizing that the components of (cid:3) 0.

By far the most common engineering examples of gyroscopic motion occur when precession takes place about an axis which is normal to the rotor axis, as in Fig. 7/14. Thus with the substitution (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:5)/2, (cid:2)z (cid:3) p, (cid:11)˙ (cid:3) (cid:5), and ΣMx (cid:3) M, we have from Eqs. 7/27 M (cid:3) I(cid:5)p [7/24] c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 564 564 Chapter 7 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Dynamics of Rigid Bodies which we derived initially in this article from a direct analysis of this special case. Now let us examine the steady precession of the rotor (symmetrical top) of Fig. 7/20 for any constant value of (cid:7) other than (cid:5)/2. The moment sin (cid:7). ΣMx about the x-axis is due to the weight of the rotor and is Substitution into Eqs. 7/27 and rearrangement of terms give us mgr mgr (cid:3) I(cid:11)˙p (cid:4) (I0 (cid:4) I)(cid:11)˙2 cos (cid:7) (cid:11)˙ We see that is small when p is large, so that the second term on the right-hand side of the equation becomes very small compared with I(cid:11)˙p. which, upon use of the previous substitution (cid:5) (cid:3) and mk2 (cid:3) I, becomes If we neglect this smaller term, we have (cid:3) mgr/(Ip) (cid:11)˙ (cid:11)˙ (cid:5) (cid:3) gr k2p [7/25] We derived this same relation earlier by assuming that the angular mo- mentum was entirely along the spin axis. Steady Precession with Zero Moment Consider now the motion of a symmetrical rotor with no external moment about its mass center. Such motion is encountered with space- craft and projectiles which both spin and precess during ﬂight. Figure 7/21 represents such a body. Here the Z-axis, which has a ﬁxed direction in space, is chosen to coincide with the direction of the angular momentum HG, which is constant since ΣMG (cid:3) 0.

The relationship between (cid:4) and (cid:7) is obtained from tan (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:3) I0(cid:2)y/(I(cid:2)z), which is /HGz HGy tan (cid:7) (cid:3) I0 I tan (cid:4) (7/29) Z H G z ω HGz ω z β θ G ⋅ φ ω y y HGy x Figure 7/21 Thus, the angular velocity (cid:2) makes a constant angle (cid:4) with the spin axis. The rate of precession is easily obtained from Eq. 7/27 with M (cid:3) 0, which gives (cid:11)˙ (cid:3) Ip (I0 (cid:4) I) cos (cid:7) (7/30) It is clear from this relation that the direction of the precession depends on the relative magnitudes of the two moments of inertia. c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 565 Article 7/11 Gyroscopic Motion: Steady Precession 565 z ω βp θ Body cone Z Space cone ψ ⋅ G Body cone Z ⋅ ψ Space cone z ω β θ G p Direct precession I0 > I Retrograde precession I0 < I (a) (b) Figure 7/22 If I0 (cid:4) I, then (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:7), as indicated in Fig. 7/22a, and the precession is said to be direct.

The rotor shaft is mounted in bearings A and B with its axis in the horizontal fore-and-aft direction and turns counterclockwise at a speed of 500 rev/min when viewed from the stern. Deter- mine the vertical components of the bearing reactions at A and B if the ship is making a turn to port (left) of 400-m radius at a speed of 25 knots (1 knot (cid:3) 0.514 m/s). Does the bow of the ship tend to rise or fall because of the gyroscopic action? p A RA 6 0 0 m m Port (left) G 9 0 0 m m y B Forward RB Starboard (right) (cid:2) Solution. The vertical component of the bearing reactions will equal the static reactions R1 and R2 due to the weight of the rotor, plus or minus the increment (cid:6)R due to the gyroscopic effect. The moment principle from statics easily gives R1 (cid:3) 5890 N and R2 (cid:3) 3920 N. The given directions of the spin velocity p and the precession velocity (cid:3) are shown with the free-body diagram of the rotor. Be- cause the spin axis always tends to rotate toward the torque axis, we see that the torque axis M points in the starboard direction as shown. The sense of the (cid:6)R’s is, therefore, up at B and down at A to produce the couple M. Thus, the bearing reactions at A and B are RA (cid:3) R1 (cid:4) (cid:6)R and RB (cid:3) R2 (cid:2) (cid:6)R The precession velocity (cid:5) is the speed of the ship divided by the radius of its turn.

(cid:3) We now observe that the forces just computed are those exerted on the rotor shaft by the structure of the ship. Consequently, from the principle of action and reaction, the equal and opposite forces are applied to the ship by the rotor shaft, as shown in the bottom sketch. Therefore, the effect of the gyroscopic couple is to generate the increments (cid:6)R shown, and the bow will tend to fall and the stern to rise (but only slightly).

(cid:3) After figuring the correct sense of M on the rotor, the common mis- take is to apply it to the ship in the same sense, forgetting the action- and-reaction principle. Clearly, the results are then reversed. (Be cer- tain not to make this mistake when operating a vertical gyro stabilizer in your yacht to counteract its roll!)

Motion in three dimensions adds considerable complexity to the kinematic and kinetic relationships. Compared with plane mo- tion, there is now the possibility of two additional components of the vectors describing angular quantities such as moment, angular veloc- ity, angular momentum, and angular acceleration. For this reason, the full power of vector analysis becomes apparent in the study of three- dimensional dynamics. We divided our study of three-dimensional dynamics into kinemat- ics, which is covered in Section A of the chapter, and kinetics, which is treated in Section B. Kinematics We arranged our coverage of three-dimensional kinematics in order of increasing complexity of the type of motion. These types are: 1. Translation. As in plane motion, covered in Chapter 5 (Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies), any two points on a rigid body have the same velocity and acceleration. 2. Fixed-Axis Rotation. In this case the angular-velocity vector does not change orientation, and the expressions for the velocity and ac- celeration of a point are easily obtained as Eqs. 7/1 and 7/2, which are identical in form to the corresponding plane-motion equations in Chapter 5. 3. Parallel-Plane Motion. This case occurs when all points in a rigid body move in planes which are parallel to a ﬁxed plane. Thus, in each plane, the results of Chapter 5 hold. 4. Rotation about a Fixed Point. In this case, both the magnitude and the direction of the angular-velocity vector may vary. Once the angular acceleration is established by careful differentiation of the angular-velocity vector, Eqs. 7/1 and 7/2 may be used to determine the velocity and acceleration of a point. 5. General Motion. The principles of relative motion are useful in analyzing this type of motion. Relative velocity and relative acceler- ation are expressed in terms of translating reference axes by Eqs. 7/4. When rotating reference axes are used, the unit vectors of the reference system have nonzero time derivatives. Equations 7/6 ex- press the velocity and acceleration in terms of quantities referred to rotating axes; these equations are identical in form to the corre- sponding results for plane motion, Eqs. 5/12 and 5/14. Equations 7/7a and 7/7b are the expressions relating the time derivatives of a vector as measured in a ﬁxed system and as measured relative to a rotating system. These expressions are useful in the analysis of gen- eral motion. c07.qxd 2/10/12 2:29 PM Page 577 Article 7/12 Chapter Review 577 Kinetics We applied momentum and energy principles to analyze three- dimensional kinetics, as follows. 1. Angular Momentum. In three dimensions the vector expression for angular momentum has numerous additional components which are absent in plane motion. The components of angular momentum are expressed by Eqs. 7/12 and depend on both moments and prod- ucts of inertia. There is a unique set of axes, called principal axes, for which the products of inertia are zero and the moments of iner- tia have stationary values. These values are called the principal mo- ments of inertia. 2. Kinetic Energy. The kinetic energy of three-dimensional motion can be expressed either in terms of the motion of and about the mass center (Eq. 7/15) or in terms of the motion about a ﬁxed point (Eq. 7/18). 3. Momentum Equations of Motion. By using the principal axes we may simplify the momentum equations of motion to obtain Euler’s equations, Eqs. 7/21. 4. Energy Equations. The work-energy principle for three-dimen- sional motion is identical to that for plane motion. Applications In Chapter 7 we studied two applications of special interest, namely, parallel-plane motion and gyroscopic motion. 1. Parallel-Plane Motion. In such motion all points in a rigid body move in planes which are parallel to a ﬁxed plane. The equations of motion are Eqs. 7/23. These equations are useful for analyzing the effects of dynamic imbalance in rotating machinery and in bodies which roll along straight paths. 2. Gyroscopic Motion. This type of motion occurs whenever the axis about which the body is spinning is itself rotating about another axis. Common applications include inertial guidance systems, stabi- lizing devices, spacecraft attitude motion, and any situation in which a rapidly spinning rotor (such as that of an aircraft engine) is being reoriented. In the case where an external torque is present, a basic analysis can be based upon the equation M (cid:3) For the case of torque-free motion of a body spinning about its axis of symmetry, the axis of symmetry is found to execute a coning motion about the ﬁxed angular-momentum vector.

A few examples of this class of dynamics problems are the response of an engi- neering structure to earthquakes, the vibration of an unbalanced rotat- ing machine, the time response of the plucked string of a musical instrument, the wind-induced vibration of power lines, and the ﬂutter of aircraft wings. In many cases, excessive vibration levels must be re- duced to accommodate material limitations or human factors. In the analysis of every engineering problem, we must represent the system under scrutiny by a physical model. We may often represent a continuous or distributed-parameter system (one in which the mass and spring elements are continuously spread over space) by a discrete or lumped-parameter model (one in which the mass and spring elements are separate and concentrated). The resulting simpliﬁed model is espe- cially accurate when some portions of a continuous system are relatively massive in comparison with other portions. For example, the physical model of a ship propeller shaft is often assumed to be a massless but twistable rod with a disk rigidly attached to each end—one disk repre- senting the turbine and the other representing the propeller. As a sec- ond example, we observe that the mass of springs may often be neglected in comparison with that of attached bodies. Not every system is reducible to a discrete model. For example, the transverse vibration of a diving board after the departure of the diver is 8 583 c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 584 584 Chapter 8 Vibration and Time Response a somewhat difﬁcult problem of distributed-parameter vibration. In this chapter, we will begin the study of discrete systems, limiting our discus- sion to those whose conﬁgurations may be described with one displace- ment variable. Such systems are said to possess one degree of freedom. For a more detailed study which includes the treatment of two or more degrees of freedom and continuous systems, you should consult one of the many textbooks devoted solely to the subject of vibrations. The remainder of Chapter 8 is divided into four sections: Article 8/2 treats the free vibration of particles and Art. 8/3 introduces the forced vibration of particles. Each of these two articles is subdivided into undamped- and damped-motion categories. In Art. 8/4 we discuss the vibration of rigid bodies. Finally, an energy approach to the solu- tion of vibration problems is presented in Art. 8/5. The topic of vibrations is a direct application of the principles of ki- netics as developed in Chapters 3 and 6. In particular, construction of a complete free-body diagram drawn for an arbitrary positive value of the displacement variable, followed by application of the appropriate gov- erning equations of dynamics, will yield the equation of motion. From this equation of motion, which is a second-order ordinary differential equation, you can obtain all information of interest, such as the motion frequency, period, or the motion itself as a function of time. 8/2 Free Vibration of Particles When a spring-mounted body is disturbed from its equilibrium posi- tion, its ensuing motion in the absence of any imposed external forces is termed free vibration. In every actual case of free vibration, there exists some retarding or damping force which tends to diminish the motion. Common damping forces are those due to mechanical and ﬂuid friction. In this article we ﬁrst consider the ideal case where the damping forces are small enough to be neglected. Then we treat the case where the damping is appreciable and must be accounted for. Equation of Motion for Undamped Free Vibration We begin by considering the horizontal vibration of the simple frictionless spring-mass system of Fig. 8/1a. Note that the variable x denotes the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position, which, for this system, is also the position of zero spring deflection. Figure 8/1b shows a plot of the force Fs necessary to deflect the spring versus the corresponding spring deflection for three types of springs. Although nonlinear hard and soft springs are useful in some applica- tions, we will restrict our attention to the linear spring. Such a spring exerts a restoring force (cid:2)kx on the mass—that is, when the mass is displaced to the right, the spring force is to the left, and vice versa. We must be careful to distinguish between the forces of magnitude Fs which must be applied to both ends of the massless spring to cause tension or compression and the force F (cid:3) (cid:2)kx of equal magnitude which the spring exerts on the mass. The constant of proportionality k is called the spring constant, modulus, or stiffness and has the units N/m or lb/ft. k m Equilibrium position x kx Fs mg N (a) Hard Linear Fs = kx Soft x (b) Figure 8/1 c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 585 Article 8/2 Free Vibration of Particles 585 The equation of motion for the body of Fig. 8/1a is obtained by ﬁrst drawing its free-body diagram. Applying Newton’s second law in the form ΣFx (cid:3) gives mx¨ (cid:2)kx (cid:3) mx¨ or mx¨ (cid:4) kx (cid:3) 0 (8/1) The oscillation of a mass subjected to a linear restoring force as de- scribed by this equation is called simple harmonic motion and is charac- terized by acceleration which is proportional to the displacement but of opposite sign. Equation 8/1 is normally written as where x¨ (cid:4) (cid:3) n 2x (cid:3) 0 (cid:3) n (cid:3) (cid:2)k/m (8/2) (8/3) is a convenient substitution whose physical signiﬁcance will be clariﬁed shortly. Solution for Undamped Free Vibration Because we anticipate an oscillatory motion, we look for a solution which gives x as a periodic function of time. Thus, a logical choice is or, alternatively, x (cid:3) A cos (cid:3) nt (cid:4) B sin (cid:3) nt x (cid:3) C sin ((cid:3) nt (cid:4) (cid:2)) (8/4) (8/5) Direct substitution of these expressions into Eq. 8/2 veriﬁes that each expression is a valid solution to the equation of motion. We determine the constants A and B, or C and (cid:2), from knowledge of the initial dis- of the mass. For example, if we work placement x0 and initial velocity with the solution form of Eq. 8/4 and evaluate x and at time t (cid:3) 0, we x˙ obtain x˙0 x0 (cid:3) A and x˙0 (cid:3) B(cid:3) n Substitution of these values of A and B into Eq. 8/4 yields x (cid:3) x0 cos (cid:3) nt (cid:4) x˙0 (cid:3) n sin (cid:3) nt (8/6) The constants C and (cid:2) of Eq. 8/5 can be determined in terms of given initial conditions in a similar manner. Evaluation of Eq. 8/5 and its ﬁrst time derivative at t (cid:3) 0 gives x0 (cid:3) C sin (cid:2) and x˙0 (cid:3) C(cid:3) n cos (cid:2) c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 586 586 Chapter 8 Vibration and Time Response Solving for C and (cid:2) yields C (cid:3) (cid:2)x0 2 (cid:4) (x˙0/(cid:3) n)2 (cid:2) (cid:3) tan(cid:2)1(x0 (cid:3) n/x˙0) Substitution of these values into Eq. 8/5 gives x (cid:3) (cid:2)x0 2 (cid:4) (x˙0/(cid:3) n)2 sin [(cid:3) nt (cid:4) tan(cid:2)1(x0 (cid:3) n/x˙0)] (8/7) Equations 8/6 and 8/7 represent two different mathematical expressions (cid:2)A2 (cid:4) B2 for the same time-dependent motion. We observe that C (cid:3) and (cid:2) (cid:3) tan(cid:2)1(A/B). Graphical Representation of Motion The motion may be represented graphically, Fig. 8/2, where x is seen to be the projection onto a vertical axis of the rotating vector of (cid:2)k/m, length C. The vector rotates at the constant angular velocity (cid:3)n (cid:3) which is called the natural circular frequency and has the units radians per second. The number of complete cycles per unit time is the natural frequency ƒn (cid:3) (cid:3)n/2(cid:4) and is expressed in hertz (1 hertz (Hz) (cid:3) 1 cycle per second). The time required for one complete motion cycle (one rota- tion of the reference vector) is the period of the motion and is given by (cid:5) (cid:3) 1/ƒn (cid:3) 2(cid:4)/(cid:3)n. τ (cid:5) 2 —– ω= n t x ω nt A C ψ B ω nt +x C x x0 0 0 −C −x Figure 8/2 We also see from the ﬁgure that x is the sum of the projections onto the vertical axis of two perpendicular vectors whose magnitudes are A and B and whose vector sum C is the amplitude. Vectors A, B, and C ro- tate together with the constant angular velocity (cid:3)n. Thus, as we have al- and (cid:2) (cid:3) tan(cid:2)1(A/B). ready seen, C (cid:3) (cid:2)A2 (cid:4) B2 Equilibrium Position as Reference As a further note on the free undamped vibration of particles, we see that, if the system of Fig. 8/1a is rotated 90(cid:2) clockwise to obtain the system of Fig. 8/3 where the motion is vertical rather than horizontal, c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 587 Article 8/2 Free Vibration of Particles 587 the equation of motion (and therefore all system properties) is un- changed if we continue to deﬁne x as the displacement from the equilib- rium position. The equilibrium position now involves a nonzero spring deﬂection (cid:6)st. From the free-body diagram of Fig. 8/3, Newton’s second law gives (cid:2)k((cid:6) st (cid:4) x) (cid:4) mg (cid:3) mx¨ At the equilibrium position x (cid:3) 0, the force sum must be zero, so that (cid:2)k(cid:6) st (cid:4) mg (cid:3) 0 Thus, we see that the pair of forces (cid:2)k(cid:6)st and mg on the left side of the motion equation cancel, giving mx¨ (cid:4) kx (cid:3) 0 which is identical to Eq. 8/1. The lesson here is that by defining the displacement variable to be zero at equilibrium rather than at the position of zero spring de- flection, we may ignore the equal and opposite forces associated with equilibrium.* Equation of Motion for Damped Free Vibration Every mechanical system possesses some inherent degree of fric- tion, which dissipates mechanical energy. Precise mathematical models of the dissipative friction forces are usually complex. The dashpot or vis- cous damper is a device intentionally added to systems for the purpose of limiting or retarding vibration. It consists of a cylinder ﬁlled with a viscous ﬂuid and a piston with holes or other passages by which the ﬂuid can ﬂow from one side of the piston to the other. Simple dashpots arranged as shown schematically in Fig. 8/4a exert a force Fd whose magnitude is proportional to the velocity of the mass, as depicted in Fig. 8/4b. The constant of proportionality c is called the viscous damping co- efﬁcient and has units of or lb-sec/ft. The direction of the damp- ing force as applied to the mass is opposite that of the velocity Thus, the force on the mass is (cid:2) N (cid:3) s/m x˙. cx˙. Complex dashpots with internal ﬂow-rate-dependent one-way valves can produce different damping coefﬁcients in extension and in compression; nonlinear characteristics are also possible. We will restrict our attention to the simple linear dashpot. The equation of motion for the body with damping is determined from the free-body diagram as shown in Fig. 8/4a.

The usual reason is that the value of the viscous damping coefﬁcient c is not otherwise well known. To determine the damping, we may excite the system by initial condi- tions and obtain a plot of the displacement x versus time t, such as that shown schematically in Fig. 8/7.

The force may be exter- nally applied or may be generated within the system by such means as unbalanced rotating parts. Forced vibrations may also be excited by the motion of the system foundation. Harmonic Excitation Various forms of forcing functions F (cid:2) F(t) and foundation displace- ments xB (cid:2) xB(t) are depicted in Fig. 8/8. The harmonic force shown in part a of the ﬁgure occurs frequently in engineering practice, and the understanding of the analysis associated with harmonic forces is a nec- essary ﬁrst step in the study of more complex forms. For this reason, we will focus our attention on harmonic excitation. We ﬁrst consider the system of Fig. 8/9a, where the body is subjected to the external harmonic force F (cid:2) F0 sin (cid:3)t, in which F0 is the force am- plitude and (cid:3) is the driving frequency (in radians per second). Be sure to distinguish between (cid:3)n (cid:2) which is a property of the system, and (cid:3), which is a property of the force applied to the system. We also note that for a force F (cid:2) F0 cos (cid:3)t, one merely substitutes cos (cid:3)t for sin (cid:3)t in the re- sults about to be developed.

Examples of such applications are seismographs, vehicle suspensions, and struc- tures shaken by earthquakes. Harmonic movement of the base is equivalent to the direct applica- tion of a harmonic force. To show this, consider the system of Fig. 8/9b where the spring is attached to the movable base. The free-body dia- gram shows the mass displaced a distance x from the neutral or equilib- rium position it would have if the base were in its neutral position. The base, in turn, is assumed to have a harmonic movement xB (cid:3) b sin (cid:3)t. Note that the spring deﬂection is the difference between the inertial dis- placements of the mass and the base. From the free-body diagram, New- ton’s second law gives (cid:2)k(x (cid:2) xB) (cid:2) cx˙ (cid:3) mx¨ or x¨ (cid:4) 2(cid:7)(cid:3) nx˙ (cid:4) (cid:3) n 2x (cid:3) kb sin (cid:3)t m (8/14) We see immediately that Eq. 8/14 is exactly the same as our basic equa- tion of motion, Eq. 8/13, in that F0 is replaced by kb. Consequently, all the results about to be developed apply to either Eq. 8/13 or 8/14. Undamped Forced Vibration First, we treat the case where damping is negligible (c (cid:3) 0). Our basic equation of motion, Eq. 8/13, becomes x¨ (cid:4) (cid:3) n 2x (cid:3) F0 m sin (cid:3)t (8/15) The complete solution to Eq. 8/15 is the sum of the complementary solution xc, which is the general solution of Eq. 8/15 with the right side set to zero, and the particular solution xp, which is any solution to the complete equation. Thus, x (cid:3) xc (cid:4) xp. We developed the complementary solution in Art. 8/2. A particular solution is investigated by assuming c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 602 602 Chapter 8 Vibration and Time Response that the form of the response to the force should resemble that of the force term. To that end, we assume xp (cid:3) X sin (cid:3)t (8/16) where X is the amplitude (in units of length) of the particular solution. Substituting this expression into Eq. 8/15 and solving for X yield X (cid:3) F0 /k 1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2 Thus, the particular solution becomes xp (cid:3) F0 /k 1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2 sin (cid:3)t (8/17) (8/18) The complementary solution, known as the transient solution, is of no special interest here since, with time, it dies out with the small amount of damping which is always unavoidably present. The particular solution xp describes the continuing motion and is called the steady-state solution. Its period is (cid:5) (cid:3) 2(cid:4)/(cid:3), the same as that of the forcing function. Of primary interest is the amplitude X of the motion. If we let (cid:6)st stand for the magnitude of the static deﬂection of the mass under a sta- tic load F0, then (cid:6)st (cid:3) F0 /k, and we may form the ratio M (cid:3) (cid:3) X (cid:6) st 1 1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2 (8/19) The ratio M is called the amplitude ratio or magniﬁcation factor and is a measure of the severity of the vibration. We especially note that M ap- proaches inﬁnity as (cid:3) approaches (cid:3)n. Consequently, if the system pos- sesses no damping and is excited by a harmonic force whose frequency (cid:3) approaches the natural frequency (cid:3)n of the system, then M, and thus X, increase without limit. Physically, this means that the motion ampli- tude would reach the limits of the attached spring, which is a condition to be avoided. The value (cid:3)n is called the resonant or critical frequency of the sys- tem, and the condition of (cid:3) being close in value to (cid:3)n with the resulting large displacement amplitude X is called resonance. For (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3)n, the magniﬁcation factor M is positive, and the vibration is in phase with the force F. For (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3)n, the magniﬁcation factor is negative, and the vibra- tion is 180(cid:2) out of phase with F. Figure 8/10 shows a plot of the absolute value of M as a function of the driving-frequency ratio (cid:3)/(cid:3)n. Damped Forced Vibration We now reintroduce damping in our expressions for forced vibra- tion. Our basic differential equation of motion is x¨ (cid:4) 2(cid:7)(cid:3) nx˙ (cid:4) (cid:3) n 2x (cid:3) F0 sin (cid:3)t m [8/13] Again, the complete solution is the sum of the complementary solution xc, which is the general solution of Eq. 8/13 with the right side equal to |M| 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 n/ωω Figure 8/10 c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 603 Article 8/3 Forced Vibration of Particles 603 zero, and the particular solution xp, which is any solution to the com- plete equation. We have already developed the complementary solution xc in Art. 8/2. When damping is present, we ﬁnd that a single sine or co- sine term, such as we were able to use for the undamped case, is not suf- ﬁciently general for the particular solution. So we try xp (cid:3) X1 cos (cid:3)t (cid:4) X2 sin (cid:3)t or xp (cid:3) X sin ((cid:3)t (cid:2) (cid:10)) Substitute the latter expression into Eq. 8/13, match coefﬁcients of sin (cid:3)t and cos (cid:3)t, and solve the resulting two equations to obtain F0 /k X (cid:3) n)2]2 (cid:4) [2(cid:7)(cid:3)/(cid:3) {[1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) (cid:10) (cid:3) tan(cid:2)1 (cid:6) 2(cid:7)(cid:3)/(cid:3) n 1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2(cid:7) n]2}1/2 (8/20) (8/21) The complete solution is now known, and for underdamped systems it can be written as x (cid:3) Ce(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:3) t (cid:4) (cid:2)) (cid:4) X sin ((cid:3)t (cid:2) (cid:10)) nt sin ((cid:3) d (8/22) Because the ﬁrst term on the right side diminishes with time, it is known as the transient solution. The particular solution xp is the steady- state solution and is the part of the solution in which we are primarily interested. All quantities on the right side of Eq. 8/22 are properties of the system and the applied force, except for C and (cid:2) (which are deter- minable from initial conditions) and the running time variable t. KEY CONCEPTS Magniﬁcation Factor and Phase Angle Near resonance the magnitude X of the steady-state solution is a strong function of the damping ratio (cid:7) and the nondimensional fre- quency ratio (cid:3)/(cid:3)n. It is again convenient to form the nondimensional ratio M (cid:3) X/(F0/k), which is called the amplitude ratio or magniﬁcation factor M (cid:3) 1 {[1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2]2 (cid:4) [2(cid:7)(cid:3)/(cid:3) n]2}1/2 (8/23) An accurate plot of the magniﬁcation factor M versus the frequency ratio (cid:3)/(cid:3)n for various values of the damping ratio (cid:7) is shown in Fig. 8/11. This ﬁgure reveals the most essential information pertinent to the forced vibration of a single-degree-of-freedom system under harmonic excitation. It is clear from the graph that, if a motion amplitude is excessive, two possi- ble remedies would be to (a) increase the damping (to obtain a larger value of (cid:7)) or (b) alter the driving frequency so that (cid:3) is farther from the resonant frequency (cid:3)n. The addition of damping is most effective near resonance. Figure 8/11 also shows that, except for (cid:7) (cid:3) 0, the magniﬁcation-factor curves do not actually peak at (cid:3)/(cid:3)n (cid:3) 1. The peak for any given value of (cid:7) can be calculated by ﬁnding the maximum value of M from Eq. 8/23. c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 604 604 Chapter 8 Vibration and Time Response M 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 ζ = 0 0.1 0.2 0.5 ζ = 1 1 2 n/ωω Figure 8/11 (cid:5) φ rad (cid:5) — 2 = 0 ζ = 1 ζ 0.5 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.5 = 1 ζ 3 0 0 1 2 3 = 0 ζ n/ωω Figure 8/12 The phase angle (cid:10), given by Eq. 8/21, can vary from 0 to (cid:4) and rep- resents the part of a cycle (and thus the time) by which the response xp lags the forcing function F. Figure 8/12 shows how the phase angle (cid:10) varies with the frequency ratio for various values of the damping ratio (cid:7). Note that the value of (cid:10) when (cid:3)/(cid:3)n (cid:3) 1 is 90(cid:2) for all values of (cid:7). To fur- ther illustrate the phase difference between the response and the forc- ing function, we show in Fig. 8/13 two examples of the variation of F and xp with (cid:3)t. In the ﬁrst example, (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3)n and (cid:10) is taken to be (cid:4)/4. In the second example, (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3)n and (cid:10) is taken to be 3(cid:4)/4.

The elements of this class of instruments are shown in Fig. 8/14a. We note that the entire system is subjected to the motion xB of the frame. Letting x denote the position of the mass relative to the frame, we may apply Newton’s second law and obtain (cid:2)cx˙ (cid:2) kx (cid:3) m d2 dt2 (x (cid:4) xB) or x¨ (cid:4) c m x˙ (cid:4) k m x (cid:3) (cid:2)x¨B where (x (cid:4) xB) is the inertial displacement of the mass. If xB (cid:3) b sin (cid:3)t, then our equation of motion with the usual notation is x¨ (cid:4) 2(cid:7)(cid:3) nx˙ (cid:4) (cid:3) 2x (cid:3) b(cid:3)2 sin (cid:3)t n which is the same as Eq. 8/13 if b(cid:3)2 is substituted for F0/m. Again, we are interested only in the steady-state solution xp. Thus, from Eq. 8/20, we have xp (cid:3) {[1 (cid:2) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) b((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2 n)2]2 (cid:4) [2(cid:7)(cid:3)/(cid:3) n]2}1/2 sin ((cid:3)t (cid:2) (cid:10)) If X represents the amplitude of the relative response xp, then the nondimensional ratio X/b is X/b (cid:3) ((cid:3)/(cid:3) n)2M where M is the magniﬁcation ratio of Eq. 8/23. A plot of X/b as a func- tion of the driving-frequency ratio (cid:3)/(cid:3)n is shown in Fig. 8/14b. The simi- larities and differences between the magniﬁcation ratios of Figs. 8/14b and 8/11 should be noted.

Under these conditions, the displacement of the mass relative to the frame is approximately the same as the absolute displace- ment of the frame, and the instrument acts as a displacement meter. To obtain a high value of (cid:3)/(cid:3)n, we need a small value of (cid:3)n (cid:3) which means a soft spring and a large mass. With such a combination, the mass will tend to stay inertially ﬁxed. Displacement meters generally have very light damping. (cid:2)k/m, On the other hand, if the frequency ratio (cid:3)/(cid:3)n is small, then M ap- proaches unity (see Fig. 8/11) and X/b (cid:3) ((cid:3)/(cid:3)n)2 or X (cid:3) b((cid:3)/(cid:3)n)2. But b(cid:3)2 is the maximum acceleration of the frame. Thus, X is proportional to the maximum acceleration of the frame, and the instrument may be used as an accelerometer. The damping ratio is generally selected so that M ap- proximates unity over the widest possible range of (cid:3)/(cid:3)n. From Fig. 8/11, we see that a damping factor somewhere between (cid:7) (cid:3) 0.5 and (cid:7) (cid:3) 1 would meet this criterion. Electric Circuit Analogy An important analogy exists between electric circuits and mechani- cal spring-mass systems. Figure 8/15 shows a series circuit consisting of a voltage E which is a function of time, an inductance L, a capacitance C, and a resistance R. If we denote the charge by the symbol q, the equa- tion which governs the charge is Lq¨ (cid:4) Rq˙ (cid:4) q (cid:3) E 1 C (8/24) This equation has the same form as the equation for the mechanical sys- tem. Thus, by a simple interchange of symbols, the behavior of the elec- trical circuit may be used to predict the behavior of the mechanical system, or vice versa. The mechanical and electrical equivalents in the following table are worth noting: L R C E Figure 8/15 MECHANICAL-ELECTRICAL EQUIVALENTS c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:16 PM Page 607 Article 8/3 Forced Vibration of Particles 607 (cid:2) (cid:3) SAMPLE PROBLEM 8/4 A 50-kg instrument is supported by four springs, each of stiffness 7500 N/m.

Determine the critical driving frequency (cid:3)c for which the oscillations of the mass m tend to become excessively large. Neglect the friction and mass associated with the pulleys. The two springs have the same stiffness k. Solution. The free-body diagram is drawn for arbitrary positive displacements x and xB. The motion variable x is measured downward from the position of sta- tic equilibrium deﬁned as that which exists when xB (cid:3) 0. The additional stretch in the upper spring, beyond that which exists at static equilibrium, is 2x (cid:2) xB. Therefore, the dynamic spring force in the upper spring, and hence the dynamic tension T in the cable, is k(2x (cid:2) xB). Summing forces in the x-direction gives (cid:2) (cid:3) [ΣFx (cid:3) mx¨] (cid:2)2k(2x (cid:2) xB) (cid:2) kx (cid:3) mx¨ which becomes x¨ (cid:4) 5k m x (cid:3) 2kb cos (cid:3)t m The natural frequency of the system is (cid:3)n (cid:3) (cid:2)5k/m.

In particle vibrations, the variable of interest is one of translation (x), while in rigid-body vibrations, the variable of pri- mary concern may be one of rotation ((cid:11)). Thus, the principles of rotational dynamics play a central role in the development of the equation of motion. We will see that the equation of motion for rotational vibration of rigid bodies has a mathematical form identical to that developed in Arts. 8/2 and 8/3 for translational vibration of particles. As was the case with particles, it is convenient to draw the free-body diagram for an arbitrary positive value of the displacement variable, because a negative displace- ment value easily leads to sign errors in the equation of motion. The practice of measuring the displacement from the position of static equi- librium rather than from the position of zero spring deﬂection continues to simplify the formulation for linear systems because the equal and op- posite forces and moments associated with the static equilibrium posi- tion cancel from the analysis. Rather than individually treating the cases of (a) free vibration, un- damped and damped, and (b) forced vibrations, undamped and damped, as was done with particles in Arts. 8/2 and 8/3, we will go directly to the damped, forced problem. Rotational Vibration of a Bar As an illustrative example, consider the rotational vibration of the uniform slender bar of Fig. 8/16a. Figure 8/16b depicts the free-body dia- gram associated with the horizontal position of static equilibrium. Equating to zero the moment sum about O yields (cid:2)P(cid:4) l 2 (cid:4) l 6(cid:5) (cid:4) mg(cid:4) l 6(cid:5) (cid:3) 0 P (cid:3) mg 4 where P is the magnitude of the static spring force. Figure 8/16c depicts the free-body diagram associated with an arbi- trary positive angular displacement (cid:11). Using the equation of rotational motion ΣMO (cid:3) (mg)(cid:4) l cos (cid:11)(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:4)P (cid:4) k as developed in Chapter 6, we write sin (cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:4)2l cos (cid:11)(cid:5) (cid:11)¨ 2l 3 3 IO cos (cid:11)(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:4)cl (cid:4) (F0 cos (cid:3)t)(cid:4) l 3 6 3 (cid:11)˙ cos (cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:4) l cos (cid:11)(cid:5) (cid:3) 3 1 9 ml2 (cid:11)¨ where IO (cid:3) (cid:4) md2 (cid:3) ml2/12 (cid:4) m(l/6)2 (cid:3) ml2/9 is obtained from the parallel-axis theorem for mass moments of inertia. I For small angular deﬂections, the approximations sin (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:11) and cos (cid:11) (cid:3) 1 may be used. With P (cid:3) mg/4, the equation of motion, upon re- arrangement and simpliﬁcation, becomes (cid:11)¨ (cid:4) c m (cid:11)˙ (cid:4) 4 (cid:11) (cid:3) k m (F0 l/3) cos (cid:3)t ml2/9 (8/25) l — 3 l — 3 l — 3 O F0 cos tω m k c l — 2 P θ O′ y l – 6 O O′ x = 0 (a) mg (b) F0 cos tω Oy Ox mg c d — dt ( l — 3 sin θ ) = cl — 3 ·θ cos θ P + k sin θ 2l — 3 (c) Figure 8/16 c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:17 PM Page 615 Article 8/4 Vibration of Rigid Bodies 615 The right side has been left unsimplified in the form M0(cos (cid:3)t)/IO, where M0 (cid:3) F0l/3 is the magnitude of the moment about point O of the externally applied force. Note that the two equal and opposite mo- ments associated with static equilibrium forces canceled on the left side of the equation of motion. Thus, it is not necessary to include the static-equilibrium forces and moments in the analysis. Rotational Counterparts of Translational Vibration At this point, we observe that Eq. 8/25 is identical in form to Eq. 8/13 for the translational case, so we may write (cid:11)¨ (cid:4) 2(cid:7)(cid:3) (cid:11)˙ (cid:4) (cid:3) 2(cid:11) (cid:3) n n M0 cos (cid:3)t IO (8/26) Thus, we may use all of the relations developed in Arts. 8/2 and 8/3 merely by replacing the translational quantities with their rotational counterparts. The following table shows the results of this procedure as applied to the rotating bar of Fig. 8/16: In the preceding table, the variable k(cid:11) in the expression for (cid:7) represents the equivalent torsional spring constant of the system of Fig. 8/16 and is determined by writing the restoring moment of the spring. For a small angle (cid:11), this moment about O is Mk (cid:3) (cid:2)[k(2l/3) sin (cid:11)][(2l/3) cos (cid:11)] (cid:3) (cid:2)(4 9kl2)(cid:11) Thus, k(cid:11) (cid:3) would be produced by a constant external moment M0. Note that M0/k(cid:11) is the static angular deﬂection which kl2. 4 9 We conclude that an exact analogy exists between particle vibra- tion and the small angular vibration of rigid bodies. Furthermore, the utilization of this analogy can save the labor of complete rederivation of the governing relationships for a given problem of general rigid-body vibration. c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:17 PM Page 616 616 Chapter 8 Vibration and Time Response SAMPLE PROBLEM 8/7 A simpliﬁed version of a pendulum used in impact tests is shown in the ﬁgure.

With this approach, we were able to account for the actions of all forces acting on the body, in- cluding frictional damping forces. There are many problems where the effect of damping is small and may be neglected, so that the total energy of the system is essentially conserved. For such systems, we ﬁnd that the principle of conservation of energy may frequently be applied with con- siderable advantage in establishing the equation of motion and, when the motion is simple harmonic, in determining the frequency of vibration. Determining the Equation of Motion To illustrate this alternative approach, consider ﬁrst the simple case of the body of mass m attached to the spring of stiffness k and vibrating in the vertical direction without damping, Fig. 8/17. As previously, we ﬁnd it convenient to measure the motion variable x from the equilib- rium position. With this datum, the total potential energy of the system, elastic plus gravitational, becomes V (cid:3) Ve (cid:4) Vg (cid:3) 1 2 k(x (cid:4) (cid:6) st)2 (cid:2) 1 2 k(cid:6) st 2 (cid:2) mgx where (cid:6)st (cid:3) mg/k is the initial static displacement. Substituting k(cid:6)st (cid:3) mg and simplifying give δ st x m Equilibrium position k m Figure 8/17 Thus, the total energy of the system becomes V (cid:3) 1 2kx2 mx˙2 (cid:4) 1 T (cid:4) V (cid:3) 1 2 2 kx2 Because T (cid:4) V is constant for a conservative system, its time deriv- ative is zero. Consequently, d dt (T (cid:4) V) (cid:3) mx˙x¨ (cid:4) kxx˙ (cid:3) 0 Canceling gives us our basic differential equation of motion x˙ mx¨ (cid:4) kx (cid:3) 0 which is identical to Eq. 8/1 derived in Art. 8/2 for the same system of Fig. 8/3. Determining the Frequency of Vibration Conservation of energy may also be used to determine the period or frequency of vibration for a linear conservative system, without having to derive and solve the equation of motion. For a system which oscillates with simple harmonic motion about the equilibrium position, from which the c08.qxd 2/10/12 5:46 PM Page 625 Article 8/5 Energy Methods 625 displacement x is measured, the energy changes from maximum kinetic and zero potential at the equilibrium position x (cid:2) 0 to zero kinetic and maximum potential at the position of maximum displacement x (cid:2) xmax. Thus, we may write Tmax (cid:2) Vmax The maximum kinetic energy is 1 2 k(xmax)2. energy is 1 2 m(x˙max)2, and the maximum potential For the harmonic oscillator of Fig. 8/17, we know that the displace- ment may be written as x (cid:2) xmax sin ((cid:3)nt (cid:4) (cid:4)), so that the maximum ve- locity is (cid:2) (cid:3)nxmax. Thus, we may write x˙max 1 2 m((cid:3) nxmax)2 (cid:2) 1 2 k(xmax)2 where xmax is the maximum displacement, at which the potential energy is a maximum. From this energy balance, we easily obtain (cid:3) n (cid:2) (cid:2)k/m This method of directly determining the frequency may be used for any linear undamped vibration. The main advantage of the energy approach for the free vibration of conservative systems is that it becomes unnecessary to dismember the system and account for all of the forces which act on each member. In Art. 3/7 of Chapter 3 and in Arts. 6/6 and 6/7 of Chapter 6, we learned for a system of interconnected bodies that an active-force diagram of the complete system enabled us to evaluate the work U(cid:3) of the external ac- tive forces and to equate it to the change in the total mechanical energy T (cid:4) V of the system. Thus, for a conservative mechanical system of interconnected parts with a single degree of freedom where U(cid:3) (cid:2) 0, we may obtain its equa- tion of motion simply by setting the time derivative of its constant total mechanical energy to zero, giving (T (cid:4) V) (cid:2) 0 d dt Here V (cid:2) Ve (cid:4) Vg is the sum of the elastic and gravitational potential energies of the system. Also, for an interconnected mechanical system, as for a single body, the natural frequency of vibration is obtained by equating the expres- sion for its maximum total kinetic energy to the expression for its maxi- mum potential energy, where the potential energy is taken to be zero at the equilibrium position. This approach to the determination of natural frequency is valid only if it can be determined that the system vibrates with simple harmonic motion. c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:17 PM Page 626 626 Chapter 8 Vibration and Time Response SAMPLE PROBLEM 8/10 The small sphere of mass m is mounted on the light rod pivoted at O and supported at end A by the vertical spring of stiffness k. End A is displaced a small distance y0 below the horizontal equilibrium position and released. By the energy method, derive the differential equation of motion for small oscillations of the rod and determine the expression for its natural frequency (cid:3)n of vibration. Damping is negligible. Solution.

However, in these previous chapters, we determined the dynamic behav- ior of a body only at a particular instant of time or found the changes in motion resulting from only ﬁnite intervals of displacement or time. Chapter 8, on the other hand, has treated the solution of the deﬁning differential equations of motion, so that the linear or angular displace- ment can be fully expressed as a function of time. Particle Vibration We divided our study of the time response of particles into the two categories of free and forced motion, with the further subdivisions of negligible and signiﬁcant damping. We saw that the damping ratio (cid:7) is a convenient parameter for determining the nature of unforced but vis- cously damped vibrations. The prime lesson associated with harmonic forcing is that driving a lightly damped system with a force whose frequency is near the natural frequency can cause motion of excessively large amplitude—a condition called resonance, which usually must be carefully avoided. Rigid-Body Vibration In our study of rigid-body vibrations, we observed that the equation of small angular motion has a form identical to that for particle vibra- tions. Whereas particle vibrations may be described completely by the equations governing translational motion, rigid-body vibrations usually require the equations of rotational dynamics. Energy Methods In the ﬁnal article of Chapter 8, we saw how the energy method can facilitate the determination of the natural frequency (cid:3)n in free vibration problems where damping may be neglected. Here the total mechanical energy of the system is assumed to be constant. Setting its ﬁrst time de- rivative to zero leads directly to the differential equation of motion for the system. The energy approach permits the analysis of a conservative system of interconnected parts without dismembering the system. Degrees of Freedom Throughout the chapter, we have restricted our attention to systems having one degree of freedom, where the position of the system can be speciﬁed by a single variable. If a system possesses n degrees of freedom, it has n natural frequencies. Thus, if a harmonic force is applied to such a system which is lightly damped, there are n driving frequencies which can cause motion of large amplitude. By a process called modal analysis, a complex system with n degrees of freedom can be reduced to n single- degree-of-freedom systems. For this reason, the thorough understanding of the material of this chapter is vital for the further study of vibrations. c08.qxd 2/10/12 2:17 PM Page 633 REVIEW PROBLEMS 8/119 Determine the value of the damping coefﬁcient c k (cid:3) 70 for which the system is critically damped if kN/m and m (cid:3) 100 kg. k k k m c c Problem 8/119 8/120 A 20-m I-beam is being hoisted by the cable arrange- ment shown.

Because this quantity plays an important role in the design of structures, especially those dealt with in statics, we present only a brief deﬁnition in this Dynamics volume so that the student can appreciate the basic differences between area and mass moments of inertia. The moments of inertia of a plane area A about the x- and y-axes in its plane and about the z-axis normal to its plane, Fig. A/1, are deﬁned by y Ix (cid:2) (cid:2) y2 dA Iy (cid:2) (cid:2) x2 dA Iz (cid:2) (cid:2) r2 dA A A x r dA y where dA is the differential element of area and r2 (cid:2) x2 (cid:3) y2. Clearly, the polar moment of inertia Iz equals the sum Ix (cid:3) Iy of the rectangular moments of inertia. For thin ﬂat plates, the area moment of inertia is useful in the calculation of the mass moment of inertia, as explained in Appendix B. The area moment of inertia is a measure of the distribution of area about the axis in question and, for that axis, is a constant property of the area. The dimensions of area moment of inertia are (distance)4 expressed in m4 or mm4 in SI units and ft4 or in.4 in U.S. customary units. In con- trast, mass moment of inertia is a measure of the distribution of mass about the axis in question, and its dimensions are (mass)(distance)2, in SI units and in lb-ft-sec2 or lb-in.-sec2 in which are expressed in U.S. customary units. kg (cid:2) m2 O x Figure A/1 639 bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:46 PM Page 640 bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:46 PM Page 641 Mass Moments of Inertia APPENDIX OUTLINE B/1 Mass Moments of Inertia about an Axis B/2 Products of Inertia B B/1 Mass Moments of Inertia about an Axis The equation of rotational motion about an axis normal to the plane of motion for a rigid body in plane motion contains an integral which de- pends on the distribution of mass with respect to the moment axis. This integral occurs whenever a rigid body has an angular acceleration about its axis of rotation. Thus, to study the dynamics of rotation, you should be thoroughly familiar with the calculation of mass moments of inertia for rigid bodies. Consider a body of mass m, Fig. B/1, rotating about an axis O-O with an angular acceleration (cid:2). All particles of the body move in parallel planes which are normal to the rotation axis O-O. We may choose any one of the planes as the plane of motion, although the one containing the center of mass is usually the one so designated. An element of mass dm has a component of acceleration tangent to its circular path equal to r(cid:2), and by Newton’s second law of motion the resultant tangential force on this element equals r(cid:2) dm. The moment of this force about the axis O-O is r2(cid:2) dm, and the sum of the moments of these forces for all ele- ments is (cid:2)r2(cid:2) dm. For a rigid body, (cid:2) is the same for all radial lines in the body and we may take it outside the integral sign. The remaining integral is called the mass moment of inertia I of the body about the axis O-O and is I (cid:2) (cid:3) r2 dm (B/1) This integral represents an important property of a body and is involved in the analysis of any body which has rotational acceleration about a O α m r dm O r dmα Figure B/1 641 bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:47 PM Page 642 642 Appendix B Mass Moments of Inertia given axis. Just as the mass m of a body is a measure of the resistance to translational acceleration, the moment of inertia I is a measure of resis- tance to rotational acceleration of the body. The moment-of-inertia integral may be expressed alternatively as I (cid:2) Σ ri 2mi (B/1a) where ri is the radial distance from the inertia axis to the representative particle of mass mi and where the summation is taken over all particles of the body. If the density (cid:3) is constant throughout the body, the moment of in- ertia becomes I (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) r2 dV where dV is the element of volume. In this case, the integral by itself de- ﬁnes a purely geometrical property of the body. When the density is not constant but is expressed as a function of the coordinates of the body, it must be left within the integral sign and its effect accounted for in the integration process. In general, the coordinates which best ﬁt the boundaries of the body should be used in the integration. It is particularly important that we make a good choice of the element of volume dV. To simplify the inte- gration, an element of lowest possible order should be chosen, and the correct expression for the moment of inertia of the element about the axis involved should be used. For example, in ﬁnding the moment of in- ertia of a solid right-circular cone about its central axis, we may choose an element in the form of a circular slice of inﬁnitesimal thickness, Fig. B/2a. The differential moment of inertia for this element is the expres- sion for the moment of inertia of a circular cylinder of inﬁnitesimal alti- tude about its central axis. (This expression will be obtained in Sample Problem B/1.) Alternatively, we could choose an element in the form of a cylindri- cal shell of inﬁnitesimal thickness as shown in Fig. B/2b. Because all of the mass of the element is at the same distance r from the inertia axis, the differential moment of inertia for this element is merely r2 dm where dm is the differential mass of the elemental shell. From the deﬁnition of mass moment of inertia, its dimensions are in SI units and (mass)(distance)2 and are expressed in the units lb-ft-sec2 in U.S. customary units. kg (cid:2) m2 r (a) (b) Figure B/2 bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:47 PM Page 643 Article B/1 Mass Moments of Inertia about an Axis 643 Radius of Gyration The radius of gyration k of a mass m about an axis for which the moment of inertia is I is deﬁned as (B/2) Thus, k is a measure of the distribution of mass of a given body about the axis in question, and its deﬁnition is analogous to the deﬁnition of the radius of gyration for area moments of inertia. If all the mass m of a body could be concentrated at a distance k from the axis, the moment of inertia would be unchanged. The moment of inertia of a body about a particular axis is fre- quently indicated by specifying the mass of the body and the radius of gyration of the body about the axis. The moment of inertia is then calcu- lated from Eq. B/2. Transfer of Axes dm m r G d O r0 θ u u C Figure B/3 If the moment of inertia of a body is known about an axis passing through the mass center, it may be determined easily about any parallel axis. To prove this statement, consider the two parallel axes in Fig. B/3, one being an axis through the mass center G and the other a parallel axis through some other point C. The radial distances from the two axes to any element of mass dm are r0 and r, and the separation of the axes is d. Substituting the law of cosines r2 (cid:2) (cid:3) d2 (cid:3) 2r0d cos (cid:4) into the def- inition for the moment of inertia about the axis through C gives r0 2 I (cid:2) (cid:3) r2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3) (r0 (cid:2) (cid:3) r0 2 dm (cid:3) d2 (cid:3) dm (cid:3) 2d (cid:3) u dm 2 (cid:3) d2 (cid:3) 2r0 d cos (cid:4)) dm The ﬁrst integral is the moment of inertia about the mass-center axis, the second term is md2, and the third integral equals zero, since the u- coordinate of the mass center with respect to the axis through G is zero. Thus, the parallel-axis theorem is I I (cid:2) I (cid:3) md2 (B/3) Remember that the transfer cannot be made unless one axis passes through the center of mass and unless the axes are parallel. When the expressions for the radii of gyration are substituted in Eq. B/3, there results k2 (cid:2) k2 (cid:3) d2 (B/3a) Equation B/3a is the parallel-axis theorem for obtaining the radius of gyration k about an axis which is a distance d from a parallel axis through the mass center, for which the radius of gyration is k. bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:47 PM Page 644 644 Appendix B Mass Moments of Inertia t dm x r y y O x z Figure B/4 For plane-motion problems where rotation occurs about an axis normal to the plane of motion, a single subscript for I is sufficient to designate the inertia axis. Thus, if the plate of Fig. B/4 has plane motion in the x-y plane, the moment of inertia of the plate about the z-axis through O is designated IO. For three-dimensional motion, however, where components of rotation may occur about more than one axis, we use a double subscript to preserve notational symmetry with product-of- inertia terms, which are described in Art. B/2. Thus, the moments of in- ertia about the x-, y-, and z-axes are labeled Ixx, Iyy, and Izz, respectively, and from Fig. B/5 we see that they become Ixx (cid:2) (cid:3) rx Iyy (cid:2) (cid:3) ry Izz (cid:2) (cid:3) rz 2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3) (y2 (cid:3) z2) dm 2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3) (z2 (cid:3) x2) dm 2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3) (x2 (cid:3) y2) dm (B/4) These integrals are cited in Eqs. 7/10 of Art. 7/7 on angular momentum in three-dimensional rotation. The deﬁning expressions for mass moments of inertia and area mo- ments of inertia are similar. An exact relationship between the two mo- ment-of-inertia expressions exists in the case of ﬂat plates. Consider the ﬂat plate of uniform thickness in Fig. B/4. If the constant thickness is t and the density is (cid:3), the mass moment of inertia Izz of the plate about the z-axis normal to the plate is Izz (cid:2) (cid:3) r2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3)t (cid:3) r2 dA (cid:2) (cid:3)tIz (B/5) Thus, the mass moment of inertia about the z-axis equals the mass per unit area (cid:3)t times the polar moment of inertia Iz of the plate area about the z-axis. If t is small compared with the dimensions of the plate in its y dm z z rz O ry rx x y x Figure B/5 bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:47 PM Page 645 Article B/1 Mass Moments of Inertia about an Axis 645 plane, the mass moments of inertia Ixx and Iyy of the plate about the x- and y-axes are closely approximated by Ixx (cid:2) (cid:3) y2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3)t (cid:3) y2 dA (cid:2) (cid:3)tIx Iyy (cid:2) (cid:3) x2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3)t (cid:3) x2 dA (cid:2) (cid:3)tIy (B/6) Thus, the mass moments of inertia equal the mass per unit area (cid:3)t times the corresponding area moments of inertia. The double subscripts for mass moments of inertia distinguish these quantities from area mo- ments of inertia. Inasmuch as Iz (cid:2) Ix (cid:3) Iy for area moments of inertia, we have Izz (cid:2) Ixx (cid:3) Iyy (B/7) which holds only for a thin ﬂat plate. This restriction is observed from Eqs. B/6, which do not hold true unless the thickness t or the z-coordinate of the element is negligible compared with the distance of the element from the corresponding x- or y-axis. Equation B/7 is very useful when dealing with a differential mass element taken as a ﬂat slice of differential thickness, say, dz. In this case, Eq. B/7 holds exactly and becomes dIzz (cid:2) dIxx (cid:3) dIyy (B/7a) for axes x and y in the plane of the plate. Composite Bodies As in the case of area moments of inertia, the mass moment of iner- tia of a composite body is the sum of the moments of inertia of the indi- vidual parts about the same axis. It is often convenient to treat a composite body as deﬁned by positive volumes and negative volumes. The moment of inertia of a negative element, such as the material re- moved to form a hole, must be considered a negative quantity. A summary of some of the more useful formulas for mass moments of inertia of various masses of common shape is given in Table D/4, Appendix D. The problems which follow the sample problems are divided into the categories Integration Exercises and Composite and Parallel-Axis Exercises. The parallel-axis theorem will also be useful in some of the problems in the first category. bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:47 PM Page 646 646 Appendix B Mass Moments of Inertia SAMPLE PROBLEM B/1 Determine the moment of inertia and radius of gyration of a homogeneous right-circular cylinder of mass m and radius r about its central axis O-O.

Solution. A transverse slice of thickness dz is selected as the element of vol- ume.

The calculation of products of inertia involves the same basic proce- dure which we have followed in calculating moments of inertia and in evaluating other volume integrals as far as the choice of element and the limits of integration are concerned. The only special precaution we need to observe is to be doubly watchful of the algebraic signs in the ex- pressions. Whereas moments of inertia are always positive, products of inertia may be either positive or negative. The units of products of iner- tia are the same as those of moments of inertia. We have seen that the calculation of moments of inertia is often simpliﬁed by using the parallel-axis theorem. A similar theorem exists for transferring products of inertia, and we prove it easily as follows. In Fig. B/6 is shown the x-y view of a rigid body with parallel axes x0-y0 passing through the mass center G and located from the x-y axes by the distances dx and dy. The product of inertia about the x-y axes by deﬁni- tion is Ixy (cid:2) (cid:3) xy dm (cid:2) (cid:3) (x0 (cid:3) dx)(y0 (cid:3) dy) dm (cid:2) (cid:3) x0 y0 dm (cid:3) dx dy (cid:3) dm (cid:3) dx (cid:3) y0 dm (cid:3) dy (cid:3) x0 dm (cid:2) Ix0 y0 (cid:3) mdx dy The last two integrals vanish since the ﬁrst moments of mass about the mass center are necessarily zero. Similar relations exist for the remaining two product-of-inertia terms. Dropping the zero subscripts and using the bar to designate the mass-center quantity, we obtain Ixy (cid:2) Ixy (cid:3) mdxdy Ixz (cid:2) Ixz (cid:3) mdxdz Iyz (cid:2) Iyz (cid:3) mdydz (B/9) y y0 dx x0 dm G O Figure B/6 y0 dy x0 x bapp02.qxd 2/11/12 2:07 AM Page 661 Article B/2 Products of Inertia 661 M (cid:2) dm h r θ z O y x Figure B/7 These transfer-of-axis relations are valid only for transfer to or from parallel axes through the mass center. With the aid of the product-of-inertia terms, we can calculate the moment of inertia of a rigid body about any prescribed axis through the coordinate origin. For the rigid body of Fig. B/7, suppose we must deter- mine the moment of inertia about axis O-M. The direction cosines of O-M are l, m, n, and a unit vector (cid:2) along O-M may be written (cid:2) (cid:2) li (cid:3) mj (cid:3) nk. The moment of inertia about O-M is IM (cid:2) (cid:3) h2 dm (cid:2) (cid:3) (r (cid:2) (cid:2)) (cid:2) (r (cid:2) (cid:2)) dm where (cid:2)r (cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2) r sin (cid:2) (cid:2) h. The cross product is (r (cid:2) (cid:2)) (cid:2) (yn (cid:4) zm)i (cid:3) (zl (cid:4) xn)j (cid:3) (xm (cid:4) yl)k and, after we collect terms, the dot-product expansion gives (r (cid:2) (cid:2)) (cid:2) (r (cid:2) (cid:2)) (cid:2) h2 (cid:2) (y2 (cid:3) z2)l2 (cid:3) (x2 (cid:3) z2)m2 (cid:3) (x2 (cid:3) y2)n2 (cid:4) 2 xylm (cid:4) 2 xzln (cid:4) 2 yzmn Thus, with the substitution of the expressions of Eqs. B/4 and B/8, we have IM (cid:2) Ixxl2 (cid:3) Iyym2 (cid:3) Izzn2 (cid:4) 2Ixylm (cid:4) 2Ixzln (cid:4) 2Iyzmn (B/10) This expression gives the moment of inertia about any axis O-M in terms of the direction cosines of the axis and the moments and products of inertia about the coordinate axes. Principal Axes of Inertia As noted in Art. 7/7, the array whose elements appear in the expansion of the angular-momentum ex- pression, Eq. 7/11, for a rigid body with attached axes, is called the iner- tia matrix or inertia tensor. If we examine the moment- and product-of-inertia terms for all possible orientations of the axes with re- spect to the body for a given origin, we will ﬁnd in the general case an orientation of the x-y-z axes for which the product-of-inertia terms van- ish and the array takes the diagonalized form bapp02.qxd 2/10/12 2:47 PM Page 662 662 Appendix B Mass Moments of Inertia Such axes x-y-z are called the principal axes of inertia, and Ixx, Iyy, and Izz are called the principal moments of inertia and represent the maximum, minimum, and intermediate values of the moments of inertia for the particular origin chosen. It may be shown* that for any given orientation of axes x-y-z the so- lution of the determinant equation (B/11) for I yields three roots I1, I2, and I3 of the resulting cubic equation which are the three principal moments of inertia. Also, the direction cosines l, m, and n of a principal inertia axis are given by (Ixx (cid:4) I)l (cid:4) Ixym (cid:4) Ixzn (cid:2) 0 (cid:4)Iyxl (cid:3) (Iyy (cid:4) I)m (cid:4) Iyzn (cid:2) 0 (cid:4)Izxl (cid:4) Izym (cid:3) (Izz (cid:4) I)n (cid:2) 0 (B/12) These equations along with l2 (cid:3) m2 (cid:3) n2 (cid:2) 1 will enable a solution for the direction cosines to be made for each of the three I’s. To assist with the visualization of these conclusions, consider the rectangular block, Fig. B/8, having an arbitrary orientation with respect to the x-y-z axes. For simplicity, the mass center G is located at the ori- gin of the coordinates. If the moments and products of inertia for the block about the x-y-z axes are known, then solution of Eq.

B/12 using each of the three I’s, in turn, along with l2 (cid:3) m2 (cid:3) n2 (cid:2) 1, would give the direction cosines l, m, and n for each of the respective principal axes, which are always mutually perpendicular.

The relationships are cited without proof. The student of mechanics will have frequent occasion to use many of these relations, and he or she will be handicapped if they are not well in hand. Other topics not listed will also be needed from time to time. As the reader reviews and applies mathematics, he or she should bear in mind that mechanics is an applied science descriptive of real bodies and actual motions. Therefore, the geometric and physical inter- pretation of the applicable mathematics should be kept clearly in mind during the development of theory and the formulation and solution of problems.

In such cases, an iterative technique, such as Newton’s method, can be a powerful tool for obtain- ing a good estimate to the root or roots of the equation. Let us place the equation to be solved in the form ƒ(x) (cid:2) 0. Part a of the accompanying ﬁgure depicts an arbitrary function ƒ(x) for values of x in the vicinity of the desired root xr. Note that xr is merely the value ƒ(x) ƒ(x) ƒ(x) ƒ(x) Tangent to ƒ(x) at x = x1 xr x3 x2 x1 x xr1 xr2 x x1 x2 x2 xr x1 x (a) (b) (c) of x at which the function crosses the x-axis. Suppose that we have avail- able (perhaps via a hand-drawn plot) a rough estimate x1 of this root. Provided that x1 does not closely correspond to a maximum or minimum value of the function ƒ(x), we may obtain a better estimate of the root xr by extending the tangent to ƒ(x) at x1 so that it intersects the x-axis at x2. From the geometry of the ﬁgure, we may write tan (cid:2) (cid:2) ƒ(cid:5)(x1) (cid:2) ƒ(x1) x1 (cid:3) x2 where ƒ(cid:5)(x1) denotes the derivative of ƒ(x) with respect to x evaluated at x (cid:2) x1. Solving the above equation for x2 results in x2 (cid:2) x1 (cid:3) ƒ(x1) ƒ(cid:5)(x1) The term (cid:3)ƒ(x1)/ƒ(cid:5)(x1) is the correction to the initial root estimate x1. Once x2 is calculated, we may repeat the process to obtain x3, and so forth. Thus, we generalize the above equation to xk(cid:4)1 (cid:2) xk (cid:3) ƒ(xk) ƒ(cid:5)(xk) bapp03.qxd 2/10/12 2:48 PM Page 682 682 Appendix C Selected Topics of Mathematics where xk(cid:4)1 (cid:2) the (k (cid:4) 1)th estimate of the desired root xr xk (cid:2) the kth estimate of the desired root xr ƒ(xk) (cid:2) the function ƒ(x) evaluated at x (cid:2) xk ƒ(cid:5)(xk) (cid:2) the function derivative evaluated at x (cid:2) xk This equation is repeatedly applied until ƒ(xk(cid:4)1) is sufﬁciently close to zero and xk(cid:4)1 (cid:8) xk. The student should verify that the equation is valid for all possible sign combinations of xk, ƒ(xk), and ƒ(cid:5)(xk). Several cautionary notes are in order: 1. Clearly, ƒ(cid:5)(xk) must not be zero or close to zero. This would mean, as restricted above, that xk exactly or approximately corresponds to a minimum or maximum of ƒ(x). If the slope ƒ(cid:5)(xk) is zero, then the tangent to the curve never intersects the x-axis. If the slope ƒ(cid:5)(xk) is small, then the correction to xk may be so large that xk(cid:4)1 is a worse root estimate than xk. For this reason, experienced engineers usu- ally limit the size of the correction term; that is, if the absolute value of ƒ(xk)/ƒ(cid:5)(xk) is larger than a preselected maximum value, that maximum value is used. 2. If there are several roots of the equation ƒ(x) (cid:2) 0, we must be in the vicinity of the desired root xr in order that the algorithm actually converges to that root. Part b of the ﬁgure depicts the condition when the initial estimate x1 will result in convergence to rather than xr2 . xr1 3. Oscillation from one side of the root to the other can occur if, for example, the function is antisymmetric about a root which is an inflection point. The use of one-half of the correction will usually prevent this behavior, which is depicted in part c of the accompa- nying figure. Example: Beginning with an initial estimate of x1 (cid:2) 5, estimate the sin- gle root of the equation ex (cid:3) 10 cos x (cid:3) 100 (cid:2) 0. The table below summarizes the application of Newton’s method to the given equation. The iterative process was terminated when the ab- solute value of the correction (cid:3)ƒ(xk)/ƒ(cid:5)(xk) became less than 10(cid:3)6. k 1 2 3 4 5 xk ƒ(xk) ƒ(cid:5)(xk) xk(cid:4)1 (cid:3) xk (cid:2) (cid:3) ƒ(xk) ƒ(cid:5)(xk) 5.000 000 4.671 695 4.596 498 4.593 215 4.593 209 45.576 537 7.285 610 0.292 886 0.000 527 (cid:3)2(10(cid:3)8) 138.823 916 96.887 065 89.203 650 88.882 536 88.881 956 (cid:3)0.328 305 (cid:3)0.075 197 (cid:3)0.003 283 (cid:3)0.000 006 2.25(10(cid:3)10) bapp03.qxd 2/10/12 2:48 PM Page 683 Article C/12 Selected Techniques for Numerical Integration 683 C/12 Selected Techniques for Numerical Integration 1. Area determination. Consider the problem of determining the shaded area under the curve y (cid:2) ƒ(x) from x (cid:2) a to x (cid:2) b, as depicted in part a of the ﬁgure, and suppose that analytical integration is not feasi- ble. The function may be known in tabular form from experimental measurements or it may be known in analytical form. The function is taken to be continuous within the interval a (cid:3) x (cid:3) b. We may divide the area into n vertical strips, each of width (cid:6)x (cid:2) (b (cid:3) a)/n, and then add the areas of all strips to obtain A (cid:2) (cid:9) y dx. A representative strip of area Ai is shown with darker shading in the ﬁgure. Three useful numerical approximations are cited. In each case the greater the number of strips, the more accurate becomes the approximation geometrically. As a gen- eral rule, one can begin with a relatively small number of strips and increase the number until the resulting changes in the area approxima- tion no longer improve the accuracy obtained. y y = ƒ(x) y0 y1 y2 y3 yn yn – 1 yi + 1 yi Ai x (a) x0 = a x1 x2 x3 xi xi + 1 x xn = b Ai yi yi + 1 ym Rectangular Ai = ym x A = y dx ym x (b) x I. Rectangular [Figure (b)] The areas of the strips are taken to be rectangles, as shown by the representative strip whose height ym is cho- sen visually so that the small cross-hatched areas are as nearly equal as possible. Thus, we form the sum Σym of the effective heights and multi- ply by (cid:6)x. For a function known in analytical form, a value for ym equal to that of the function at the midpoint xi (cid:4) (cid:6)x/2 may be calculated and used in the summation. II. Trapezoidal [Figure (c)] The areas of the strips are taken to be trapezoids, as shown by the representative strip. The area Ai is the average bapp03.qxd 2/10/12 2:48 PM Page 684 684 Appendix C Selected Topics of Mathematics height (yi (cid:4) yi (cid:4) 1)/2 times (cid:6)x. Adding the areas gives the area approxima- tion as tabulated. For the example with the curvature shown, clearly the approximation will be on the low side. For the reverse curvature, the ap- proximation will be on the high side.

Parabolic [Figure (d)] The area between the chord and the curve (neglected in the trapezoidal solution) may be accounted for by approximating the function by a parabola passing through the points deﬁned by three successive values of y. This area may be calculated from the geometry of the parabola and added to the trapezoidal area of the pair of strips to give the area (cid:6)A of the pair as cited. Adding all of the (cid:6)A’s produces the tabulation shown, which is known as Simpson’s rule. To use Simpson’s rule, the number n of strips must be even. from x (cid:2) 0 Example: Determine the area under the curve to x (cid:2) 2.

Integration of ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations. The application of the fundamental principles of mechanics frequently results in differential relationships. Let us consider the ﬁrst-order form dy/dt (cid:2) ƒ(t), where the function ƒ(t) may not be readily integrable or may be known only in tabular form. We may numerically integrate by means of a simple slope-projection technique, known as Euler integra- tion, which is illustrated in the ﬁgure. y(t) dy Slope = ƒ(t) –– dt y(t) Slope = ƒ(t3) Slope = ƒ(t2) Slope = ƒ(t1) y1 y2 y4 y3 Accumulated algorithmic error etc. t t1 t2 t3 t4 Beginning at t1, at which the value y1 is known, we project the slope over a horizontal subinterval or step (t2 (cid:3) t1) and see that y2 (cid:2) y1 (cid:4) ƒ(t1)(t2 (cid:3) t1). At t2, the process may be repeated beginning at y2, and so forth until the desired value of t is reached. Hence, the general expres- sion is yk(cid:4)1 (cid:2) yk (cid:4) ƒ(tk)(tk(cid:4)1 (cid:3) tk) If y versus t were linear, i.e., if ƒ(t) were constant, the method would be exact, and there would be no need for a numerical approach in that case. Changes in the slope over the subinterval introduce error. For the case shown in the ﬁgure, the estimate y2 is clearly less than the true value of the function y(t) at t2. More accurate integration techniques (such as Runge-Kutta methods) take into account changes in the slope over the subinterval and thus provide better results. As with the area-determination techniques, experience is helpful in the selection of a subinterval or step size when dealing with analytical functions. As a rough rule, one begins with a relatively large step size and then steadily decreases the step size until the corresponding changes in the integrated result are much smaller than the desired ac- curacy. A step size which is too small, however, can result in increased error due to a very large number of computer operations. This type of error is generally known as “round-off error,” while the error which re- sults from a large step size is known as algorithm error. bapp03.qxd 2/10/12 2:48 PM Page 686 686 Appendix C Selected Topics of Mathematics Example: For the differential equation dy/dt (cid:2) 5t with the initial condi- tion y (cid:2) 2 when t (cid:2) 0, determine the value of y for t (cid:2) 4.

(a) Use preﬁxes to keep numerical values generally between 0.1 and 1000. (b) Use of the preﬁxes hecto, deka, deci, and centi should generally be avoided except for certain areas or volumes where the numbers would be awkward otherwise. (c) Use preﬁxes only in the numerator of unit combinations. The one exception is the base unit kilogram. (Example: write kN/m not N/mm; J/kg not mJ/g) (d) Avoid double preﬁxes. (Example: write GN not kMN) 2. Unit designations (a) Use a dot for multiplication of units. (Example: write N (cid:2) m not Nm) (b) Avoid ambiguous double solidus. (Example: write N/m2 not N/m/m) (c) Exponents refer to entire unit. (Example: mm2 means (mm)2) 3. Number grouping Use a space rather than a comma to separate numbers in groups of three, counting from the decimal point in both directions. (Example: 4 607 321.048 72) Space may be omitted for numbers of four digits. (Example: 4296 or 0.0476) bendpaper.qxd 2/10/12 7:49 PM Page B2 Conversion Charts Between SI and U.S. Customary Units bendpaper.qxd 2/10/12 7:49 PM Page B3 Conversion Charts Between SI and U.S. Customary Units (cont)
